Anyone can share their apps with other users on  data variables.product.prodname_marketplace  but only organizations that are verified by  data variables.product.company_short  can sell apps. For more information about organizations, see About organizations(/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/about-organizations). The verification process aims to protect users. For example, it verifies the sellers identity, checks that their  data variables.product.product_name  organization is set up securely, and that they can be contacted for support. After passing the verification checks, any apps that the organization lists on  data variables.product.prodname_marketplace  are shown with a verified creator badge  octicon verified aria-labelVerified creator badge . The organization can now add paid plans to any of their apps. Each app with a paid plan also goes through a financial onboarding process to check that its set up to handle billing correctly. !verified creator badges(/assets/images/marketplace/marketplace_verified_creator_badges_apps.png) In addition to the verified creator badge, youll also see badges for unverified and verified apps. These apps were published using the old method for verifying individual apps. !Green verified and grey unverified badge(/assets/images/marketplace/marketplace_verified_badges.png) For information on finding apps to use, see Searching  data variables.product.prodname_marketplace (/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-github-marketplace).  About the verification process The first time you request verification for a listing of one of your apps, you will enter the verification process. An onboarding expert will guide you through the process. This includes checking - Profile information - The basic profile information is populated accurately and appropriately. - Security - The organization has enabled two-factor authentication. - Verified domain - The organization has verified the domain of the site URL. - Purchase webhook event - The event is handled correctly by the app. When your organization is verified, all your apps are shown with a verified creator badge. You are now able to offer paid plans for any of your apps.

Authorization, authentication, and access control We recommend creating a GitHub App rather than an OAuth App.  data reusables.marketplace.github_apps_preferred . See Differences between GitHub Apps and OAuth Apps(/apps/differences-between-apps/) for more details. - Apps should use the principle of least privilege and should only request the OAuth scopes and GitHub App permissions that the app needs to perform its intended functionality. For more information, see Principle of least privilege(https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) in Wikipedia. - Apps should provide customers with a way to delete their account, without having to email or call a support person. - Apps should not share tokens between different implementations of the app. For example, a desktop app should have a separate token from a web-based app. Individual tokens allow each app to request the access needed for GitHub resources separately. - Design your app with different user roles, depending on the functionality needed by each type of user. For example, a standard user should not have access to admin functionality, and billing managers might not need push access to repository code. - Apps should not share service accounts such as email or database services to manage your SaaS service. - All services used in your app should have unique login and password credentials. - Admin privilege access to the production hosting infrastructure should only be given to engineers and employees with administrative duties. - Apps should not use personal access tokens to authenticate and should authenticate as an OAuth App(/apps/about-apps/about-oauth-apps) or a GitHub App(/apps/about-apps/about-github-apps) - OAuth Apps should authenticate using an OAuth token(/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/). - GitHub Apps should authenticate using either a JSON Web Token (JWT)(/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/authenticating-as-a-github-app), OAuth token(/apps/building-github-apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps/), or installation access token(/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/authenticating-as-an-installation).  Data protection - Apps should encrypt data transferred over the public internet using HTTPS, with a valid TLS certificate, or SSH for Git. - Apps should store client ID and client secret keys securely. We recommend storing them as environmental variables(http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variableGetting_and_setting_environment_variables). - Apps should delete all GitHub user data within 30 days of receiving a request from the user, or within 30 days of the end of the users legal relationship with GitHub. - Apps should not require the user to provide their GitHub password. - Apps should encrypt tokens, client IDs, and client secrets.  Logging and monitoring Apps should have logging and monitoring capabilities. App logs should be retained for at least 30 days and archived for at least one year. A security log should include - Authentication and authorization events - Service configuration changes - Object reads and writes - All user and group permission changes - Elevation of role to admin - Consistent timestamping for each event - Source users, IP addresses, and/or hostnames for all logged actions  Incident response workflow To provide a secure experience for users, you should have a clear incident response plan in place before listing your app. We recommend having a security and operations incident response team in your company rather than using a third-party vendor. You should have the capability to notify  data variables.product.product_name  within 24 hours of a confirmed incident. For an example of an incident response workflow, see the Data Breach Response Policy on the SANS Institute website(https//www.sans.org/information-security-policy/). A short document with clear steps to take in the event of an incident is more valuable than a lengthy policy template.  Vulnerability management and patching workflow You should conduct regular vulnerability scans of production infrastructure. You should triage the results of vulnerability scans and define a period of time in which you agree to remediate the vulnerability. If you are not ready to set up a full vulnerability management program, its useful to start by creating a patching process. For guidance in creating a patch management policy, see this TechRepublic article Establish a patch management policy(https//www.techrepublic.com/blog/it-security/establish-a-patch-management-policy-87756/). 94 ...ent/developers/github-marketplace/security-review-process-for-submitted-apps.md This file was deleted. 53 content/developers/github-marketplace/setting-pricing-plans-for-your-listing.md  -1,6 1,6  --- title Setting pricing plans for your listing intro When listing your app on  data variables.product.prodname_marketplace (/marketplace/listing-on-github-marketplace/), you can choose to provide your app as a free service or sell your app. If you plan to sell your app, you can create different pricing plans for different feature tiers. intro When you list your app on  data variables.product.prodname_marketplace , you can choose to provide your app as a free service or sell your app. If you plan to sell your app, you can create different pricing plans for different feature tiers. redirect_from - /apps/adding-integrations/managing-pricing-and-payments-for-a-github-marketplace-listing/setting-a-github-marketplace-listing-s-pricing-plan/ - /apps/marketplace/managing-pricing-and-payments-for-a-github-marketplace-listing/setting-a-github-marketplace-listing-s-pricing-plan/  -17,57 17,52  versions free-pro-team  ---  About setting pricing plans If you want to sell an app on  data variables.product.prodname_marketplace , you need to request verification when you publish the listing for your app. During the verification process, an onboarding expert checks the organizations identity and security settings.

Discussions are for conversations that need to be transparent and accessible but do not need to be tracked on a project board and are not related to code, unlike issues. Discussions enable fluid, open conversation in a public forum. Discussions give a space for more collaborative conversations by connecting and giving a more centralized area to connect and find information.  Enabling  data variables.product.prodname_discussions  on your repository Repository owners and people with write access can enable  data variables.product.prodname_discussions  for a community on their public repositories.

Click Start discussion. !Start discussion button(/assets/images/help/discussions/new-discussion-start-discussion-button.png)  Welcoming contributions to your discussions You can welcome your community and introduce a new way to communicate in a repository by creating a welcome post and pin the post to your  data variables.product.prodname_discussions  page. Pinning and locking discussions helps people know that a post is meant as an announcement. You can use announcements as a way to link people to more resources and offer guidance for opening discussions in your community. For more information about pinning a discussion, see Managing discussions in your repository(/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-discussions-in-your-repositorypinning-a-discussion).  Setting up community guidelines for contributors You can set contributing guidelines to encourage collaborators to have meaningful, useful conversations that are relevant to the repository. You can also update the repositorys README to communicate expectations on when collaborators should open an issue or discussion. For more information about providing guidelines for your project, see Adding a code of conduct to your project(/github/building-a-strong-community/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project) and Setting up your project for healthy contributions(/github/building-a-strong-community/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions).  Creating a new discussion Anyone with access to a repository can create a discussion.  data reusables.discussions.starting-a-discussion   Organizing discussions into relevant categories Repository owners and people with write access can create new categories to keep discussions organized. Collaborators participating and creating new discussions can group discussions into the most relevant existing categories. Discussions can also be recategorized after they are created. For more information, see Managing categories for discussions in your repository(/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-categories-for-discussions-in-your-repository)  Promoting healthy conversations People with write permissions for a repository can help surface important conversations by pinning discussions, deleting discussions that are no longer useful or are damaging to the community, and transferring discussions to more relevant repositories owned by the organization.

Each organization can have multiple classrooms. After you create a classroom,  data variables.product.prodname_classroom  will prompt you to invite teaching assistants (TAs) and admins to the classroom. Each classroom can have one or more admins. Admins can be teachers, TAs, or any other course administrator who youd like to have control over your classrooms on  data variables.product.prodname_classroom . Invite TAs and admins to your classroom by inviting the user accounts on  data variables.product.product_name  to your organization as organization owners and sharing the URL for your classrom. Organization owners can administer any classroom for the organization.

GitHub,Python-Career-Opportunities-,Imimmu,"Python is point of fact the Next Big Thing to investigate. There is no need to be worried about its worth, profession possibilities, or accessible positions. Pythons commitment to the advancement of your calling is huge, as its notoriety among designers and different areas is step by step waning. Python is the one for an assortment of reasons. Its a straightforward pre-arranged language that is not difficult to get. Subsequently, the general improvement time for the task code is diminished. It accompanies an assortment of structures and APIs that assistance with information examination, perception, and control. Employment opportunities in Python While India has a critical interest for Python engineers, the stock is very restricted. Well utilize a HR master articulation to validate this. For both Java and Python, the expert was relied upon to employ ten developers. For Java, they got over 100 fantastic resumes, however just eight for Python. In this way, while they needed to go through an extensive method to get rid of resilient people, they had no real option except to acknowledge those eight individuals with Python. What does this say about the circumstance to you? Regardless of Pythons straightforward language structure, we desperately need more individuals in India to update their abilities. This is the reason learning Python is a particularly colossal opportunity for Indians. With regards to work openings, there may not be numerous for Python in India. Notwithstanding, we have countless assignments accessible per Python developer. In the relatively recent past, one of Indias unicorn programming organizations was stood up to with an issue. It had gotten a 200 million (Rs. 1200 crore) arrangement to develop an application store for a significant US bank. Be that as it may, the organization required talented Python developers. Since Python was the best language for the undertaking, it wound up paying a gathering of independent Python developers in the United States multiple times the charging sum. For sure and Naukri, for instance, have 20,000 to 50,000 Python work postings, showing that Python vocation openings in India are copious. It is an insightful choice to seek after a profession in Python. The diagrams underneath show the absolute number of occupation advertisements for the most well known programming dialects. Python Job Descriptions Anyway, what sorts of work would you be able to get in the event that you know Python? Pythons degree is broad in information science and investigation, first off. Customers regularly demand that secret examples be separated from their informational indexes. In AI and man-made reasoning, it is additionally suggested. Python is a top choice among information researchers. Furthermore, we figured out how Python is used in web advancement, work area applications, information examination, and organization programming in our article on Python applications. Python Job Profiles With Python on your resume, you might wind up with one of the accompanying situations in a presumed organization 1. Programmer Investigate client necessities Compose and test code Compose functional documentation Counsel customers and work intimately with other staff Foster existing projects 2.

Pythons future is splendid, on account of 1.Artificial Intelligence (AI) Machine knowledge is alluded to as man-made consciousness. This is as a conspicuous difference to the regular astuteness that people and different creatures have. It is one of the most up to date advances that is clearing the globe. With regards to AI, Python is one of the main dialects that rings a bell truth be told, it is probably the most ideally equipped language for the work. We have different structures, libraries, and devices devoted to permitting AI to swap human work for this objective. It supports this, however it additionally further develops productivity and precision. Discourse acknowledgment frameworks, self-driving vehicles, and other AI-based advancements are models. The accompanying devices and libraries transport for these parts of AI AI  PyML, PyBrain, scikit-learn, MDP Toolkit, GraphLab Create, MIPy General AI  pyDatalog, AIMA, EasyAI, SimpleAI Neural Networks  PyAnn, pyrenn, ffnet, neurolab Normal Language and Text Processing  Quepy, NLTK, genism 2. Enormous Data Enormous Data is the term for informational collections so voluminous and complex that conventional information handling application programming is insufficient in managing them.

GitHub,Pset-9,Rprokap,"CREDITS SEQUENCE NEWSPAPER HEADLINE MONTAGE HEADLINES flash before us, displaying their accompanying photographs. UBERMAN - METRO CITYS HERO AFTER DEFEATING MASTER MIND! PHOTO A chiseled, statuesque man wearing the COOLEST SUPER HERO SUIT IMAGINABLE, COMPLETE WITH FLOWING CAPE, shines a confident smile at the lens. This is UBERMAN, champion of METRO CITY. UBERMAN DEFEATS MASTER MINDS GIANT ROBOT! PHOTO Wide-shot of Uberman in mid-flight lifting the GIANT ROBOT in the sky above the city buildings. MASTER MIND ALL WET AFTER UBERMAN FOILS AQUARIUM HEIST! PHOTO Uberman stands knee-deep in water. He has his enemy by the collar. The villain blocks his face from the shot with a METALLIC GAUNTLET. The images start to flash by even quicker, each showing the MYSTERIOUS VILLAIN in various stages of humiliation. In each photograph he successfully blocks his face with his armored glove. We ZOOM IN to the last headline. MASTER MIND BEHIND BARS ONCE AGAIN - THANKS TO UBERMAN! PHOTO Uberman stands in a gallant pose with his fists on his hips, obviously trying to accentuate the U insignia on his chest. END OF CREDITS SEQUENCE EXT. BUILDING - DAY We DISSOLVE from the photograph to Uberman standing in the exact same position. WE PULL BACK showing him atop a BUILDING overlooking the city below. A perfect view for our guardian hero. He watches the thriving metropolis, bristling with life as people happily go about their day. Yet, we cant help but detect a hint of sadness in Ubermans expression. 2. UBERMAN You look so peaceful from up here. His serenity is suddenly interrupted by a loud BEEPING SOUND coming from his wrist. He looks down at a BRACELET (a manly one) on his right arm. Its a silver band with a FLASHING red letter U. UBERMAN (CONTD) Looks like Roxannes in trouble again. Uberman leaps off the building and into the air. His cape gracefully flows in the breeze behind him as he shoots off into the distance like a speeding bullet. EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - ESTABLISHING SHOT Grime and moss decorate the outside of this long abandoned building overlooking the COAST. Once a place of knowledge and wonder - now home to a great evil. INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY The inside is in complete contrast to the exterior. The huge hall with a GIANT TELESCOPE teems with advanced ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT. Computers, monitors and machines which do not have an obvious function FLASH and HUM. A STEEL DOOR slides open, revealing the subject of our story MASTER MIND - a villainous sight to behold. His FACE IS INEXPLICABLY LIGHT BLUE, topped by an OVERSIZED, MUSHROOM- SHAPED HEAD with a CIRCULAR PATCH OF WHITE HAIR ON TOP. Hes dressed in the kind of costume only a super villain could pull off a PURPLE JUMPSUIT AND BLACK BOOT ENSEMBLE WITH A GIANT GREEN M ON THE CHEST. His right hand, hanging at his side, is a METAL GAUNTLET WITH THREE SHORT SPIKES PROTRUDING BETWEEN HIS KNUCKLES. Master Mind begins to survey the room with his TWO PERMANENTLY ARCHED EYEBROWS. A man dressed as ALBERT EINSTEIN is busy ranting to two other men. One, a hulking brute, is dressed as LEONARDO DA VINCI. The other, a small intellectual-type carrying a clip-board, is dressed as the philosopher PLATO. EINSTEIN I hate the outfits. I mean, I get it were all supposed to be masterminds - very clever. (MORE) 3. EINSTEIN(contd) I just feel stupid. I mean, what the hell did Einstein really do anyway? PLATO Theory of relativity. Einstein starts feverishly scratching his side. EINSTEIN Well, youd think hed invent a wool sweater that didnt itch so much. Da Vinci and Platos eyes suddenly grow with concern as they see Master Mind walk up behind Einstein. Einstein notices his colleagues staring over his right shoulder and turns around. He turns around and Master Mind SEIZES HIM BY HIS THROAT with his metal gauntlet. MASTER MIND The real Einstein once said, God does not play dice with the world. He was right, because the world is MY dice. Is that understood? DA VINCI  PLATO Sir! Yes, sir! EINSTEIN (gasping for air) Yes, sir. Master Mind undoes his grip on Einsteins throat. MASTER MIND Alright, then - clean slate. Do we have the girl? DA VINCI Yes, sir. She fell into our trap just like you knew she would. MASTER MIND Reporters are a curious lot, and easily manipulated. He quickly checks his physique in a GIANT MIRROR, adjusts his posture and sucks in his gut. 4. MASTER MIND Alright, lets not keep the lady waiting. MOMENTS LATER Da Vinci escorts a BLINDFOLDED and bound woman, ROXANNE RITCHI, to the back of the room where Plato and Einstein are standing guard over a large BLACK SWIVEL-CHAIR facing away from us. She pulls free of Da Vincis grasp and waits for him to undo the blindfold. Her face uncovered, we finally see Roxannes striking features - all of which seem overshadowed by piercing eyes that seem more put off by the situation than afraid of it. MASTER MIND (O.S.) Miss Ritchi, we meet again. The chair turns menacingly slow, finally revealing Master Mind. ROXANNE You didnt need to turn around like that. I can recognize the stench of failure. Master Mind unleashes a wicked laugh. MASTER MIND I trust you gentlemen know the very sassy Roxanne Ritchi, highly regarded investigative journalist who some say has a more than friendly relationship with our super powered foe Uberman. And Miss Ritchi, I trust youve already met my new crew The Mad Geniuses! Roxanne gives Einstein a once over. ROXANNE Looks like a real group of winners. At the risk of sounding cliche, youll never get away with this. MASTER MIND In a way, I already have. Roxanne unleashes an exhausted SIGH. 5. ROXANNE We go through this every time. You kidnap me to get to Uberman, he immediately finds your hideout, escapes whatever lame trap youve come up with, and takes you and your cronies to jail. I propose we just save everybody some heartache this time by YOU letting me go, and ME forgetting this whole thing ever happened? MASTER MIND What about my revenge? ROXANNE We can say it was wasting everyones time. MASTER MIND You have a wicked tongue. I hope you rid yourself of that when youre my queen. Roxanne unleashes a snort-filled laugh. ROXANNE Im sorry. What makes you think I would want to be your queen? MASTER MIND Power corrupts absolutely, Miss Ritchi. And when I have ultimate power over this city, I have absolutely every intention of corrupting you with it. PLATO Sir! Master Mind turns to Plato whos now standing at a computer terminal. MASTER MIND (annoyed) What is it!? EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY Uberman flies toward the Observatory like a rocket. 6. INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY Uberman crashes through the wall to the room we were just in. He looks around, but theres suddenly NOT A SOUL IN SIGHT. CUT TO EXT. MASTER MINDS HYDROFOIL - DAY The boat is shooting through the ocean, away from the observatory. INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY Machines, cables and terminals criss-cross the crafts main bridge. Through the enormous surrounding windows we can see the observatory shrinking in the distance. Master Mind watches Uberman on a small TV monitor as the hero intently searches his hideout. UBERMAN (on monitor) Master Mind! INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY Uberman throws up his arms in frustration when suddenly - MASTER MIND (O.S.) Over here, old friend. He turns to see a FAMILIAR BLUE FACE OF EVIL ON A GIANT SCREEN. UBERMAN Whats the matter, miss your old jail cell? Uberman starts walking toward the monitor. MASTER MIND (ON MONITOR) Actually, I wanted to share the experience with my oldest friend. A MECHANIZED CAGE shoots out of the floor, suddenly trapping Metro Citys protector. Totally unfazed, our hero stares on. 7. UBERMAN You cant possibly believe this will work. Master Mind pulls out a SMALL BLACK BOX with a SINGLE RED BUTTON on it. MASTER MIND (ON MONITOR) Oh, cant I? I have attained control of the Earths most abundant energy source. I doubt even you are strong enough to withstand the FULL CONCENTRATED POWER OF THE SUN!!! He presses the button. EXT. OUTER SPACE A sinister-looking SATELLITE orbits Earths atmosphere. Its bay doors suddenly open, deploying two huge SOLAR PANELS. The panels shift, angling themselves in the direction of the sun. They immediately start GLOWING as they absorb the burning stars power. The front of the satellite begins to make a loud HUMMING SOUND as it prepares to unleash its unholy power. INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY From the giant window we can see the boat is a good mile from the observatory. PLATO Were now at minimum safe distance, master. Master Mind turns from the CAMERA he was broadcasting on and puts down the control box. MASTER MIND Excellent. Stop here, I like this view. PLATO Twenty seconds until impact. Master Mind turns to Roxanne who is being held by Da Vinci and Einstein. She almost appears a little bored. Disappointed by her lack of horror, he walks over to the monitor now showing Uberman trapped in the cage. 8. MASTER MIND Any last words? Uberman looks up at the screen with a cocky smile. UBERMAN (ON MONITOR) Yes theres no caging the power of justice. PLATO Ten seconds to impact. On the screen we see Uberman take two of the cages bars in his hands. He yanks...NOTHING. PLATO (CONTD) Nine... Master Mind stares at the monitor, slightly confused. PLATO (CONTD) Eight... Uberman yanks on the bars again, this time using his foot as leverage. MASTER MIND (genuinely concerned) Whats going on? UBERMAN (straining) Hold...on...a second. Master Mind looks back at Plato and Einstein. Theyre equally befuddled at the heros sudden weakness. PLATO Seven... Uberman loses his grip and FALLS BACKWARD ON HIS ASS. UBERMAN SON OF A BITCH!! Master Mind and the minions all cringe in unison. Da Vinci turns to Roxanne not believing his ears. DA VINCI What did he just say? 9. PLATO Six......Five... Master Mind begins to laugh. MASTER MIND What kind of trick is this? Uberman looks up at the camera with a very grave expression. UBERMAN Like you dont know. These bars are made of copper, arent they? PLATO Four... MASTER MIND Yeah, so? Uberman tries to shield his grief with his hand. UBERMAN You figured out my weakness, damn you. I CANT BEND COPPER! PLATO Three... MASTER MIND Your weakness is copper? PLATO Two...one. Everyone turns to the window. EXT. OUTER SPACE The satellite fires a giant BEAM OF LIGHT toward the earth. EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY The beam hits the observatory. The building instantly EXPLODES in a white nova blast of fire. INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY The blast is so bright everyone turns away from the window. Then, as suddenly as it began, the awesome light dies out. One by one, the passengers unshield their eyes and look out toward the observatory. 10. All we can see through the haze of destruction is fire and smoke. PLATO I dont think even he could have survived that. Einstein suddenly turns giddy with excitement. EINSTEIN Whoa! Is it me or did you just finally destroy Uberman? MASTER MIND (carefully skeptical) Well...lets not get ahead of ourselves. Da Vinci suddenly sees something outside. DA VINCI Look, theres something in the sky, coming this way. ROXANNE Uberman! Master Mind turns toward the window. An object is in the air, flying directly toward them. As it closes in we can just make out the FAMILIAR OUTLINE OF A CAPPED FIGURE. MASTER MIND I KNEW IT! PREPARE YOURSELVES! HES GONNA RAM US!!! Everyone scatters and braces themselves for the impact. Master Mind, seeing all the good places taken, doesnt know what to do with himself. He just covers his giant head with his hands. The figure CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW and lands at his feet. He looks down to see a CHARRED BLACK HUMAN SKELETON. Around its neck is the unmistakable black cape of Uberman. MASTER MIND (CONTD) (horrified) HOLY SHIT! 11. Roxanne breaks out of Da Vincis hold and runs over to the body. ROXANNE Uberman? She stares down at the still smoking corpse, the tattered black cape with the yellow U on it. Roxanne turns to Master Mind, whos still visibly dumbfounded at the grotesque sight before him. ROXANNE (CONTD) You killed him! Roxannes eyes roll back. Da Vinci catches her from behind as she FAINTS. Einstein turns to Master Mind, looking at him as if hes just walked on water. EINSTEIN You did it! Now that hes committed the impossible - our villain is at a complete loss. MASTER MIND ...so I did. EINSTEIN I mean, I know you always wanted to. I mean, all the schemes all the plots - I never thought youd actually be capable of it. Giddy as a school girl, Einstein turns to his fellow henchmen. EINSTEIN This is history. Every villain and lackey in the history of villains and lackeys dream of this moment, but when does it actually EVER happen? A sudden realization comes over his face. EINSTEIN Good lord...You do all realize what we get to do now, dont you? 12. His question is met with acquisitive looks from Master Mind and the others. EINSTEIN We get to go on a crime wave. CRIME WAVE MONTAGE - SET TO Fun Fun Fun by The Beach Boys. SPINNING HEADLINE UBERMANS DEATH IGNITES CITY WIDE CRIME WAVE! ARMORED TRUCK Its driving along when the men inside suddenly notice something - THEYRE FLYING HIGH ABOVE THE CITY STREETS. We PULL BACK to see the truck being carried by a giant claw at the bottom of a BRAIN COPTER. Inside the cockpit Master Mind and his henchmen laugh maniacally. SPINNING HEADLINE CHAMPION-LESS CITY AT THE MERCY OF HOOLIGANS. METRO CITY BANK Da Vinci and Einstein run out the front of the bank holding BAGS OF MONEY. Two beat officers see them and take chase after them around the corner and into an alley. After a moment the police reemerge from the alley screaming and running for their lives as a GIANT ROBOT CHASES after them. The robot stops, then suddenly its head opens up like convertible car top with Master Mind and Plato at the drivers wheel. They smile and shake hands at a bad deed well done. SPINNING HEADLINE MASTER MIND BLACKMAILS METRO!!! A VICIOUS TORNADO Its heading for downtown Metro as Master Mind and the lackeys coolly look on. Three large DUMP TRUCKS pull up, filled to the brim with bricks of CASH. 13. The DRIVERS jump out as the lackeys take the driver seats in the three trucks. Master Mind is about to climb into the passenger seat of one when a drivers taps him on the shoulder and motions toward the tornado. MASTER MIND (absentmindedly) Oh, right. Master Mind pulls a television REMOTE from his pocket and aims it at approaching windstorm of death. He presses the button marked Tornado Off. The tornado shrinks and disappears just before it hits the city. As they drive through the city streets, Master stares out the window with a hint of something in his eyes. Is it melancholy? END OF MONTAGE EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY Its Metro Citys premier bowling alley. On top of the neon lit building is a GIANT 30 FOOT TALL CEMENT BOWLING BALL. INT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY HAL STEWART (early 30s) takes careful aim with his BOWLING BALL. HAL Its a sport of honor, focus and grace. Honor the ball, focus on the pins, release the ball not hard and fast, but as if you were releasing a baby dove. He takes a step, pulls back his arm, and releases the ball, following it with his eyes. Its a horrible shot - INSTANT GUTTER BALL. An aged barmaid type with a cigarette hanging from her mouth looks over at him. HAL Okay, do something like that - but center it more. 14. She picks up her custom made FOGHAT BALL and takes aim. ATTRACTIVE BLOND Tell me how my form looks, honey. Hal focuses on the misshapen bumps of her enormous Johnson administration era derriere. HAL Oh, its lookin good. Its lookin REAL good. It doesnt get anymore clear. This man is a pig. VINNIE (O.S.) Hal, I want to see you in my office! Hal turns to see VINNIE, owner of the bowling alley, calling him. VINNIE Now! INT. KINGPIN BOWLING - VINNIES OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER Hal sits down, facing Vinnie whos sitting at his desk. VINNIE Youre fired. Leave your shirt and locker key. This bit of news hits Hal like a freight train. HAL Fired? Are you going to tell me why? VINNIE Showing up to work late. Showing up to work late drunk. Sexually harassing customers. Stealing from the register. HAL Vinnie, I dont know where youre getting these accusations - Vinnie takes out a video tape from his desk drawer and puts in a VCR. 15. HAL Oh, which one do you supposedly have here? VINNIE This is all of them at once. TELEVISION A WOMAN walks up to a BOWLING EMPLOYEE and hands him a pair of shoes. As the employee turns to the wall of shoes, a very drunk and disheveled Hal comes running in and pushes him aside. HAL Ive got this one, Benny. So, Cinderella. Can I help you find your glass slipper? WOMAN Yeah, Im looking for a seven. He folds his arms on the counter and leans into her with a cat-like grin on his face. HAL (with a leer) Seven - Well, maybe I could interest you in something in an EIGHT. Namely, me. Disgusted, she walks off screen. HAL Lesbo. Suddenly realizing the registers open, he quickly grabs a stack of cash and shoves it in his pocket. BACK TO OFFICE Vinnie turns off the television and waits for Hal to respond. HAL From the angle of the camera, I can see where you might have gotten the wrong idea. Listen, Vinnie, I dont think youve thought this through. If you fire me, whos gonna be captain of the alleys bowling team? 16. VINNIE Um, I dont know. Maybe somebody who can actually bowl. You guys have never won a game. I hired you because you said you were on the pro circuit. HAL No, I said I WILL BE on the pro circuit. VINNIE Please, a loser like you will never amount to anything. This harsh remark seems to leave Hal genuinely stunned. HAL Wow...If thats how you feel...I guess we should then talk about what kind of severance Im gonna get. EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY TWO BRUISERS open the door and throw Hal out onto the street. He quickly picks himself up and turns back toward the building. HAL Hey...what about my ball? A bowling ball sails past him, just missing his head. HAL Thank-you! EXT. CHANNEL 7 NEWS BUILDING - DAY The massive building with a giant 7 on the roof stands in the heart of Metro City. INT. CHANNEL 7 NEWS BUILDING - OFFICE - DAY The cubicles and offices are alive with the hustle and bustle of a busy news day. Phones are RINGING, REPORTERS are TALKING, and Editors are SHOUTING. The elevator doors open and out steps Roxanne Ritchi. 17. Everything stops as the entire office suddenly falls SILENT. Somewhat taken aback by the reaction, Roxanne scans the room to see every eye on her. ROXANNE Its...um...Its good to be back. Thanks for everyones cards and concerns. I really appreciated it - now Im ready to climb back on the horse. No one is budging - their looks of pity are really starting to make her uncomfortable. The back office door suddenly opens and out comes FRANK BONIN, the gruff, middle-aged Producer of Channel 7 News. Noticing the silence, he looks up and sees the sad expressions on everybodys face. FRANK Someone die or something? He suddenly notices Roxanne - both feet are placed firmly in his mouth. FRANK (cursing himself) Oh, Jesus. ROXANNE Its okay. Frank quickly walks up to Roxanne and takes her gently by the arm. FRANK Come on into my office, sweetie. INT. CHANNEL 7 NEWS BUILDING - FRANKS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS He sits her down on his leather couch, then quickly turns toward his door. FRANK Can we get this woman some water for Gods sake? (to Rebecca) I gave you two months off. Whatre you doing back? People are gonna think Im a slave driver. 18. ROXANNE Arent you? FRANK Yeah, but I dont want people to think it. ROXANNE Frank, listen. I want to go back to work. I NEED to go back to work. FRANK ...Youre hysterical, arent you? Frank sits down on the couch and blankets Roxanne with A WARM EMBRACE. ROXANNE Whatre you doing? FRANK Keeping you warm before you go into shock. (toward the open door) DO I HAVE SLICE OPEN A CAMEL HUMP TO GET A GLASS OF WATER AROUND HERE? A SECRETARY quickly enters with a bottled water. She sets it on the table in front of them and leaves. Roxanne pulls herself out of Franks grasp and stands up to face him. ROXANNE It was a traumatic experience. Yes, everyone knows Uberman and me were...close. But what I really need - what would really make me better is getting back to work. Theres a sudden awkward silence from Frank. FRANK Well, thats going to be... ROXANNE I thought youd be happy to have me back. 19. FRANK Oh, we are. Honey, nothing makes us happier than to have our girl back, but... ROXANNE Yes? FRANK Things have sorta...changed. ROXANNE In three weeks? FRANK Listen, Im not one who likes to open up wounds - especially ones that are just starting to scab, but you were sorta our go to girl for the exclusive on Uberman. And now that hes gone...I moved Brad into your anchor spot. ROXANNE (disgusted) Brad? Brad Helms? The man is an idiot. FRANK Its the suits. They think its time to switch things up. ROXANNE Oh, because they cant use me to get the big story. FRANK Cmon, Roxie. Using is in the nature of what we do. They used you, you used Uberman. Everybodys happy. ROXANNE (defensive) I didnt use him. FRANK Oh, I didnt mean that. I know you two were in love or something. My bad. ROXANNE We were. 20. FRANK And thats great. ROXANNE Very in love. Theres a hind of self-doubt in Roxannes expression, as if shes failed to convince even herself of this. ROXANNE Okay. So, where are they going to move me if Brad has my spot? FRANK ...Human interest. ROXANNE Bake sales and pet stories. FRANK I told them I wouldnt be surprised if you just upped and quit. You busted your ass for that desk. Roxanne can hardly get it out - shes busy swallowing her pride ROXANNE Ill take it. Frank looks up at her, not believing what hes hearing. FRANK What? EXT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY - NIGHT Amongst the jungle of high rises, one small building stands out from the rest - A tiny, forgotten piece of 19th century Gothic architecture. LIGHTENING FLASHES, revealing TWO CONCRETE GARGOYLES holding a cracked plaque, reading METRO CITY LIBRARY. INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY - NIGHT A mixture of old and new. Dusty Victorian furniture and dilapidated bookshelves sit side by side with pristinely futuristic machinery. The building has been converted into Master Minds new SECRET LAIR. 21. In the center of the main room is a three storey tall GLOWING BLUE ORB. At the base of it is a sign that reads Reactor - Dont Touch. We PAN OVER to the READING ROOM where Master Mind is sitting on a couch watching TELEVISION. REPORTER ON TELEVISION (O.S.) Its been nearly six weeks, and still no word on the whereabouts of billionaire playboy, and philanthropist, Wayne Scott. Tune in at 1100 as we look into what has become Metro Citys biggest mystery. TELEVISION NARRATOR (O.S.) We now return to The Hero of our Hearts The Uberman story. Einstein and Plato come into the room holding a BAG OF LOOT. EINSTEIN Just robbed the diamond exchange. MASTER MIND (feigning pleasure) Great, great. Put it on the pile. Einstein tosses it on a LARGE PILE of purloined valuables in the corner of the room. EINSTEIN Anything else today? MASTER MIND No. Master Mind turns his attention back to the screen. Plato sees that Master Mind is in a funk and tries to snap him out of it. PLATO (cheerfully) Sir, the new reactor is installed. Plato nods to the giant orb. PLATO Do you want to throw the switch? I know how you love to start reactors. 22. MASTER MIND Maybe later. Einstein gives Master Mind a funny look then exchanges glances with Plato before leaving the two of them alone. Without turning away from the TV, Master Mind addresses Plato. MASTER MIND (CONTD) What is it, Plato? PLATO (nervously) Sir, I cant help but notice that youve been...a little down lately. MASTER MIND When I want your opinion Ill beat it out of you. PLATO Yes, sir, I know, but please forgive my impertinence. Its just that you seem to have lost your lust for our profession. Youve stopped going on jobs and spend most of your time watching Uberman specials. Master Mind relaxes slightly and turns to face the window in a classically contemplative pose. After an overdramatic beat... MASTER MIND I have defeated my greatest enemy. I have free reign over Metro City. I have more wealth than a thousand Sultans. Ive achieved all I have worked for...so why am I so unhappy? He walks over to a PAINTED PORTRAIT that looks almost exactly like him, except slightly older, maybe meaner - MASTER MINDS FATHER. MASTER MIND I mean, my father, god rest his evil and tormented soul, raised me straight from the test tube to be a symbol of evil. (MORE) 23. MASTER MIND(contd) And, I have accomplished something he had only dreamed about - the destruction of Metro Citys champion. I tell you, Ive always lived with this unquenchable thirst. I thought it was to make him proud or to get absolute power. But now that Ive pretty much accomplished both, I am at a loss. PLATO ...I sort of have a theory about all that. MASTER MIND (snippy) Oh, really? PLATO Well, for one thing, maybe Uberman was more important to you than you thought. MASTER MIND He was a worthy rival. Sometimes I wonder, did he consider me his evil equal or was I just an annoying, little gnat to him? ...Whats the second part? PLATO I think you sort of have a thing for Roxanne Ritchi. Master Mind quickly takes his lackey by the throat. MASTER MIND YOU WORM! HOW DARE YOU! WHERE WOULD YOU GET SUCH A NOTION? PLATO Sir, your plans always involve Ms. Ritchi either being kidnapped or placed in danger. If thats not love, I dont know what is. Its the grown up equivalent of dipping her pigtails in the ink well. Dont you see? Shes the one treasure thats always escaped you. From Master Minds expression, we see Platos words beginning to ring true. 24. INT. RESTURAUNT - DAY Roxanne is having lunch with several girlfriends sitting around her, gabbing. FRIEND 1 I cant believe you came back so soon. FRIEND 2 Are you sure its not TOO SOON, honey? ROXANNE I just wanted to get back to work. FRIEND 3 What we need to do is get you back on the saddle...the love saddle. Friend 1 and 2 give 3 disapproving looks. FRIEND 3 Its been three weeks. FRIEND 2 She just lost the love of her life, Grace. A WAITER comes by with a tray of CAESAR SALADS and begins setting them out for the ladies. ROXANNE I keep trying to tell people it wasnt really like that. Uberman and I - We were kinda having problems. We broke up. The waiter ALMOST DROPS HIS TRAY AT THIS. The women are too shocked by Roxannes revelation to notice. FRIEND 1 You broke up with Uberman! FRIEND 3 You must have REALLY, REALLY high standards. I mean, you were dating a god. I mean, whats it take? ROXANNE Maybe someone whos a little more aware of his faults. Someone a little more sensitive. 25. FRIEND 3 Right. Someone who listens, sexy but attainable with cute little cheeks like a hamster and heartbreak in his eyes. She turns to Friend one and two to explain. FRIEND 3 She wants John Cusack. FRIEND 2 The actor? FRIEND 3 No, the famous pediatrist - Yes, the actor. Ever since we were teenagers, Roxannes totally had the hots for him. ROXANNE Well, until he miraculously comes walking into my life, Im just going to take a little reflection time for myself. The waiter gets a confused look on his face then slips away as Roxanne and her friends continue to chat away. EXT. RESTURAUNT - DAY The waiter tosses his apron in a trash can, then rolls up his sleeve and presses A STRANGE LOOKING DEVICE STRAPPED TO HIS WRIST. His image gets staticy, like a TV station going out, then disappears - revealing the mans true form underneath MASTER MIND! MASTER MIND Who the hell is John Cusack? EXT. CITY STREET - DAY A YOUNG MOTHER pushes her baby stroller past a building construction site. ACROSS THE STREET A local POLITICIAN addresses a group of REPORTERS on the sidewalk, including Roxanne. 26. POLITICIAN The Fifth Avenue Renovation Project, which I championed, will breath new life into the downtown area. New life means new jobs and new revenue. ROXANNE Councilman, is it true that your brother-in-laws construction company won the contract for this project? POLITICIAN Well...er...yes, but...look Im not here to answer a lot of crazy questions... YOUNG MOTHER The young mother stops halfway down the block, reaches into the stroller and tries to comfort her now crying baby. Above her, a CRANE is maneuvering a pile of STEEL GIRDERS to an upper floor. Hal comes around the corner and heads in her direction. CRANE The crane GRINDS TO A HALT. The OPERATOR has a confused look on his face as he moves levers back and forth in an effort to fix the problem. Hal stops a few feet from the woman and stoops down to tie his shoe. CRANE The operators hand slips off the lever, hitting a RED BUTTON. To his horror the crane DROPS ITS LOAD OF STEEL. HAL AND THE WOMAN The woman looks up to see the girders seconds from crushing her and her baby. She screams. Hal looks up and sees it as well. He starts to run out of the way and crashes into the woman and stroller. ACROSS THE STREET 27. The reporters turns their cameras just in time to catch on film what appears to be Hal pushing the woman to safety just as the GIRDERS CRASH TO THE GROUND. HAL AND MOTHER Tears of joy in her eyes, the woman picks up her baby and kisses it. Hal struggles to catch his breath as the mother turns to him. YOUNG MOTHER Thank you! Thank you for saving me and my baby! She hugs him with her free arm, weeping with joy. HAL (not knowing what shes talking about) Huh? Hes a little uncomfortable with the womans public display of affection and the small child in-between their embrace. HAL (CONTD) There, there. Hal slowly eases out of the womans grip. HAL (CONTD) Okay, we better...well, I hear these little guys smother easy. The reporters rush over and surround Hal and the mother. ROXANNE Whats it feel like to be a hero? Hal looks up at Roxanne. Instantly, hes captivated by her beauty. HAL Well...Im just a man doing what men do. Youre Roxanne Ritchi, arent you? Theyre suddenly interrupted when another reporter pushes his way in between them. REPORTER Were you scared? 28. HAL Scared? Who had time? The reporters eat this up. INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY - NIGHT TELEVISION John Cusack stands in the rain looking up at a window of a two story house. He holds up a BOOMBOX and In Your Eyes by Peter Gabriel begins to play. From the couch, Master Mind and his minions watch. MASTER MIND John Cusack, huh? So all I have to do is have a cute puppy dog stare, be willing to make a fool of myself and - Oh, REMOVE BOTH MY BALLS. He turns to see Da Vinci watching the movie and wiping a tear from his cheek. MASTER MIND Please, get a hold of yourself. INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT Roxanne is carrying a large paper coffee cup in her hands as she peruses the isles. She sets it down on a shelf to pull a book out and ends up KNOCKING THE DRINK OVER. ROXANNE Shit. She goes to pick it up when someone bends down and picks it up for her. Looking up to thank him, Roxanne is suddenly stunned speechless - Its popular and critically acclaimed actor JOHN CUSACK, or rather Master Mind disguised as him. JOHN CUSACK Oh the humanity - it was a Venti. ROXANNE (stunned) Youre...youre. JOHN CUSACK Yes, its me. John Cusack...the actor. 29. He notices the book shes reading. JOHN CUSACK Hey, is that Shelly? Wait, I think remember something from that one - Lets see My head is screaming I want you and need you - my heart it keeps reaching to see you and feel you - yet in the end, Im alone once again. Wow, I scare even myself. Im sorry. Im just really into poetry. Probably because Im so sensitive and always going to great lengths to express myself. But enough about me. Can I fill you up? ROXANNE (captivated) ...Yes. (catching herself) I mean, excuse me? JOHN CUSACK Can I fill you up? Your coffee. ROXANNE Right. INT. BOOKSTORE CAFE - LATER Roxanne talks as John Cusack listens to her every word intently. ROXANNE I did have a boyfriend - until fairly recently. She suddenly begins to feel the stares around her as passers- by being to notice who shes with. ROXANNE Im sorry - this is so surreal! JOHN CUSACK Yeah, they charge way too much at these places - Now back to your boyfriend. Im interested and compassionate. I want to know about you. 30. ROXANNE Things were complicated. He was a man married to his work. There was...there was a lot of competition in his line of business. Im sure you know what thats like. JOHN CUSACK Sure. In my business, one thing I have is RIVALS. For example, mine is...uh...Lou Ferr...igno. ROXANNE ...The body-builder who used to play The Hulk on TV? JOHN CUSACK Did he? Well, were always up for the same roles. Did your boyfriend have someone like that? A particular rival that was always getting his goat - so to speak? ROXANNE Well...one rival in particular seemed to get more of his attention than I ever did. But enough about my problems. JOHN CUSACK NO, TELL ME MORE!!! Suddenly realizing his outburst, he begins COUGHING to mask it. JOHN CUSACK (CONTD) Im sorry. I got a whooping cough. Had it ever since Serendipity. I WONDER WHERE OUR REFILLS ARE!!! (fakes cough) See, there it goes again. Please, go on. ROXANNE Right, well, he seemed to need him more than he needed me. JOHN CUSACK How do you mean? 31. ROXANNE It was conflict he thrived on. He always said he wouldnt know what to do with himself if Master - I mean, this guy were gone. It was like he needed it, like oxygen. The answer to his mental funk hits him like a bolt of lightening. He turns away from her as if for private time. JOHN CUSACK (almost to himself) I think I finally understand...The only logical answer is to recreate that rivalry - or if thats impossible, create one of equal structure. Thats it! ROXANNE What? John Cusack snaps out of his dream-like haze realizing shes heard every word. JOHN CUSACK Oh, sorry, sorry. Just rehearsing for a part...where I play a man who talks to himself at inappropriate times. In a sudden rush, he rises out of his chair. JOHN CUSACK I have to go right now, but Id really like to see you again - if thats alright. Roxanne looks up at him - She cant help but laugh at the craziness of the situation. ROXANNE Id love that. INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY - DAY Master storms in the office to find Plato and Einstein playing darts with the original Mona Lisa. EINSTEIN Got her nose! MASTER MIND Ive got it! 32. Everyone stops what theyre doing upon seeing that their master has returned. MASTER MIND Ive got it! MASTER MIND Its plain and simple. Extraordinary minds need extraordinary stimulation. Without that stimulus they wither and die. Therefore, there is only one logical conclusion I must create a new superhero. EINSTEIN Yeah, maybe thats not such hot idea... MASTER MIND (ignoring him) Prepare for Operation Superhero Genesis! INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY - LABORATORY - DAY The lab is slick, white and ultra modern. Dressed in a lab coat, Master Mind enters through a SLIDING GLASS DOOR rubbing his hands excitedly. MASTER MIND Prepare the subject. He glances down into a large HOLE in the floor to see a naked thirty year old man, SEVERS, shivering. Above the hole, a huge vat dangles precariously. Master Mind steps behind a glass partition next to Plato and Einstein. MASTER MIND (CONTD) Plato, pour the toxic waste. Plato throws a switch causing the vat to tip hundreds of gallons of green and brown goo into the hole. MASTER MIND (CONTD) Drainage. The slime is sucked out through the floor, leaving a goo- soaked Severs. 33. Master Mind looks into the pit. MASTER MIND (CONTD) Well, Severs? SEVERS I feel fine. Just a little sticky, but aside from that everythings completely - BOOM - Severs explodes. A hail of blood and tissue covers Master Mind and his men. For a good ten seconds nobody moves an inch. Finally... MASTER MIND Okay then. INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY - LABORATORY - DAY Through a glass WATER TANK we see a man breathing normally. MASTER MIND And this one? PLATO We attached gills to him. He can breath under water. MASTER MIND Ah. Does he have extraordinary strength? PLATO Well...no. MASTER MIND Can he fly? PLATO No. MASTER MIND Resilient to weapons fire? PLATO No. MASTER MIND He just breathes under water, then. PLATO Ah...yeah. 34. Master Mind rolls his eyes and walks away. INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY - LABORATORY - DAY The next guinea-pig, STENWICK, is standing in a sealed glass tube not much wider than himself. MASTER MIND Plato, the radioactive spider, please. Plato throws the switch DROPPING A SINGLE SPIDER onto Stenwicks arm. Stenwick looks and winces as it bites him. STENWICK Ow! He brushes the spider off. MASTER MIND Anything, Stenwick? STENWICK (shaken) No. Ah...sir, I didnt know this was about spiders. I have a pretty severe case of arachnophobia. Master Mind thinks for a moment, then turns to Plato. MASTER MIND Were gonna need more venom. Plato throws another switch, this time DUMPING THOUSANDS OF SPIDERS on poor Stenwick. His SCREAMS begin to fade as hes engulfed with swarms of crawling arachnids. MASTER MIND (CONTD) How bout now, Stenwick? ....Stenwick? INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY - OFFICE - DAY Master Mind is pacing back and forth. The muted TV plays in the background. MASTER MIND This has proven to be a challenge. I just dont know what I want. What do I want? 35. He stares at Einstein, Da Vinci and Plato, but they offer no advice. MASTER MIND (CONTD) I want a man of moral fiber with a strong sense of right and wrong. Someone who doesnt seek power - instead, they must have it thrust upon them and find, within themselves, the courage to rise to the occasion. Einstein lets out a short laugh, getting everyones attention. EINSTEIN Yeah, well, it sounds like what you want is Uberman. Master Mind snaps the fingers of his non-metal hand. MASTER MIND Thats it! Why make a copy when the real thing will do? The lackeys look at each other, they cant believe what theyre hearing. EINSTEIN I was just kidding, sir. In case you forgot, you actually burned Uberman alive. MASTER MIND Then well make a new one. Plato, bring me the box! MINUTES LATER Master Mind and the lackeys stand in a circle around a small table. Plato places a STAINLESS STEEL CHEST in the tables center. As Master Mind opens it, hes immediately doused in WHITE GLOW emanating from inside. MASTER MIND Behold - Uberessence. The very thing that gave Uberman his superhuman powers. 36. EINSTEIN Where the hell did you get that? MASTER MIND Oh, I shot him with a power sucking gun and had this idea to use this to clone a whole army of evil Ubermen. Im not sure why I never got around to following up with that. PLATO I believe he defeated you before you could, master. MASTER MIND ...Right. Man, he was good! DA VINCI You want another volunteer, sir? MASTER MIND Not another volunteer driven by the need for personal gain. Somebody else, somebody pure. Master Mind turns to see an INTERVIEW WITH HAL playing on the muted television. Underneath his face is a blue caption with white lettering that reads Hal Stewart - Metro Citys Newest Hero? NEWS REPORTER ...who risked his own life to save that of a young mother and her child. HAL Please, please, youre embarrassing me. I saw someone in need and I helped them. What more can we ask of ourselves. I ask you, what more? A smile creeps across the evil ones face. MASTER MIND (CONTD) Somebody like him! EXT. CITY STREET - DAY Plato is sitting in the van, staring into a pair of binoculars as he speaks on a cellphone. 37. PLATO Yeah, sir. This guy is a real piece of work. He used to teach bowling at Kingpins. INT. MASTER MINDS HIDEOUT - DAY Master Mind is sitting with his feet up on a computer console as he speaks to Plato. MASTER MIND (into phone) A modest profession to brilliantly hide his true heroic nature. I love it. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY PLATO Then you are absolutely going to love this - We follow Platos line of sight across the street where we see HAL PLAYING WITH A LARGE GROUP OF BLIND CHILDREN. PLATO - He volunteers at a school for the blind. INT. MASTER MINDS HIDEOUT - DAY Intrigued, he suddenly sits up in his chair. MASTER MIND He volunteers. He doesnt ask for any reward for his deeds. The fates are shining down on me. This Mr. Stewart is truly an unselfish soul. EXT. BLIND SCHOOL - DAY From a distance, Hal seems to be consoling an upset child whos sitting on a rock. But up close... HAL You greedy little bastard. I already gave you a twenty. BLIND KID Hey, you want me to play along? Then pay up, bitch! 38. HAL Fine, but you better be convincing. He gives the kid a bill out of his wallet and looks over his shoulder to see a HOT TEACHER walking toward them. HAL Here she comes, go to work. Like a miniature Brando, the blind kid buries his face in his hands and begins to cry. BLIND KID (weeping) Why cant I see! Why God? Hal puts a warm consoling hand on the weeping boys shoulder. HAL Hey, Peter. Cmon champ, let me look at you. The Hot Teacher stops and curiously watches from a distance. The boy looks up at Hal, tears running down his dark sunglasses - he should get an Oscar. HAL You know, in life were all given no more than we can bear. This happened to you maybe because you were meant to rise above it - Maybe to be an inspiration to the other little Peteys out there. BLIND KID You really think so, Hal? HAL Hey, does it LOOK like Im lying? Now cmon, go feel your way to class before you get your little butt suspended. The boy stands up and is about to take off. HAL Petey, wait a minute. Hal uses his shirt sleeve to wipe the tears away from the boys face before sending him on his way. 39. The Hot Teacher grabs her chest. Her heart is about to absolutely melt. HAL Dont run into anything! EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS Plato lowers his binoculars. From his perspective, Hal should be next in line for popehood. PLATO I think Ive seen enough, sir. This is your guy. MASTER MIND (O.S.) (over radio) Then return to base. We have much work to do. Plato starts up the van and pulls away. INT. BAR - DAY Its a busy night. A couple of trucker types are shooting pool as the bartender slings drinks. Hal is nursing a beer at the bar when he suddenly notices a very ATTRACTIVE WOMAN sitting next to him. As he goes to straighten his stool-posture, Hal suddenly catches himself on the bars TELEVISION - its a story about how he saved the woman and her baby at the construction site. He turns back to the Attractive Woman next to him, then back to the TV. A plan of attack is forming. HAL (obviously playing it up for the womans benefit) Oh, there it is again. This is really getting embarrassing now. The woman looks up at the screen and gives Hal a double-take. ATTRACTIVE WOMAN Oh my God! Its you! Youre the man who saved that woman and her baby the other day! It is you, isnt it? TRUCKER 1, getting a drink at the bar next to them, OVERHEARS. 40. Hal rolls his eyes and puts his hands up in the air. HAL (to Attractive Woman) Oh, crap. You got me. TRUCKER1 taps Hal on the shoulder. TRUCKER1 Let me tell you something. That was just about the bravest damn thing Ive ever witnessed. (he turns to the rest of the bar) Hey, everybody! This guys the hero from TV! The bar ERUPTS IN CHEERS. MOMENTS LATER Hal is riding on the shoulders of TRUCKER2 and TRUCKER3 as Im Holding Out For A Hero plays on the jukebox. TRUCKER1 suddenly puts his hands in the air. The room quickly goes silent. TRUCKER1 I want to give you something. He reaches into his pocket and takes out a medal. He holds it up in the air for everyone to see. TRUCKER1 (CONTD) Lost my whole platoon. They were a lot a good boys, a lot of good boys. That was just the way things were in The Grenada. Id rather a real hero have this. Trucker1 gives the medal to a speechless Hal. ATTRACTIVE WOMAN Hey, youre on TV again. The crowd looks up at the Television. TELEVISION - CONTINUOUS The anchor man, BRAD HELMS (early 40s, amazing mustache), suddenly has a memo passed to him. 41. BRAD HELMS This just in. Upon a second look at that tape from this morning, which well now replay for you, it appears it was not the heroic act it first seemed to be. The tape shows Hal running in slow motion. BRAD HELMS (O.S.) (CONTD) With the tape slowed down you can actually see the man push the woman and her child out of the way in an effort to save his own life. The tape shows Hal, in a clear act of self-preservation, pushing the woman and child out of the way. CUT BACK TO INT. BAR - CONTINUOUS In unison, everyone turns their heads back to Hal. HAL I guess that looks kinda bad. Trucker1 snatches his medal back. EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT Master Mind, Da Vinci and Plato look down, spotting Hal cutting through a dark alley. DA VINCI There he is, boss. Da Vinci hands Master Mind a fantastic looking silver rifle. MASTER MIND Now, were sure this wont kill him? PLATO Yes, sir. Hell just feel a slight electrical shock. MASTER MIND Good. Master Mind raises the rifle and aims it at Hal. 42. EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT Hal wipes the blood from his nose with his shirtsleeve. A LIGHTENING BOLT suddenly zaps Hal in the back. His teeth spark and arc electrons as his entire body shakes and shudders violently. He finally collapses, knocking over a row of garbage cans. EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT An angry Master Mind slaps Plato. MASTER MIND Slight electrical shock? EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT Hal lies flat on his back, his jacket smoldering. Dazed, he slowly rises to his feet and looks up at the sky. HAL God, I hate the weather in this city. Hal walks off into the night as he attempts to slap the emitting smoke from his jacket. EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT Master Mind turns to Da Vinci. MASTER MIND Follow him. INT. HALS APARTMENT - NIGHT Its a dirty, small studio. Laundry lies everywhere, dishes are piled in the sink and the litter box looks like a minefield. Hal comes staggering in. Through his POV we see the lights wobble and streak like a hallucination. He shakes his head trying to clear thing up, but it looks worse. Hal makes his way to the kitchen table and plops down on a chair. The room begins to swim. His CAT jumps on the table and sits down in front of him. 43. From Hals POV the cats face looks like were seeing it through a kaleidoscope. Hal seems fascinated by it. CAT You dont look so good, man. HAL I dont feel good. I was struck by freaking lightening. Suddenly Hal realizes his cats talking to him. HAL (CONTD) AAAAAAHHHHH! You can talk? CAT No, youre just hallucinating. By the way, were out of orange juice. HAL AAAAAAHHHHH! Hal jumps up, trips over a cardboard box and knocks himself out on the coffee table. INT. HALS APARTMENT - MORNING Hal lies in the same position we left him last night. He sits up and grabs his head. He looks like he has the worst hangover in the world. Finally, he remembers last night. He looks around, but not really sure what hes looking for. HAL Man... Shaking his head, he walks to the kitchen and opens the refrigerator. He pulls out an orange juice container and puts it to his mouth. Its empty. As if suddenly remembering something he looks from the carton to the cat, who is busy cleaning himself. He shakes the thought from his mind. BATHROOM Hal lifts the seat and unbuckles his pants. 44. HALS FACE He stares at the ceiling with half closed eyes. The inevitable sound of urine hitting water starts. A content look washes over his face. There is a distinct sound of porcelain CRACKING and SPLINTERING. The sound intensifies. Hal looks down to see his URINE STREAM SMASHING THE TOILET. HAL (CONTD) Oh, God! He whips his stream away only to cut a LONG RIP IN THE WALL. HAL (CONTD) Oh, God! He freaks out and begins to lose control of his flow as it destroys everything he accidently aims at the bathroom mirror, a bottle of cheap cologne, the bathroom window. HAL (CONTD) Oh, God! He aims back for the toilet, which is pretty much rubble now, to see the floor give way. Finally, the pee stops and he glances down the hole. He sees his downstairs NEIGHBOR sitting at his breakfast table. He has a fork halfway to his mouth as he stares at the smashed toilet on his pancakes. EXT. STREET - DAY Hal turns the corner to see his bus pulling away from the stop. HAL Wait! He starts running after it. ZOOM - HE TAKES OFF LIKE LIGHTENING. HAL (CONTD) Whoa, whoa, whoa! Unable to stop, he SLAMS INTO THE BACK OF THE BUS and falls back to the ground. 45. As the bus continues on he sees an INDENTATION of his torso right below the rear window. Stunned, to say the least, he rises to his feet. HAL (CONTD) Somethings not right here. He slaps himself in the face as hard as he can. HAL (CONTD) Wake up! Wake up, Hal! HONK! Hal spins around to see a car barreling toward him. He goes to jump out of the way - ZOOM - he FLIES TWO STORIES UP, nails a building and comes crashing back down to the sidewalk. Hal sits up, disheveled and scared. HAL (CONTD) Okay, okay. Lets get it together, man. He closes his eyes in an attempt to will back his sanity. HAL (CONTD) This is just some sort of...episode. It will pass, it will pass. He opens his eyes and looks down the street. A BEAUTIFUL NAKED WOMAN is coming toward him. HAL (CONTD) Well, not too fast I hope. As she passes him and turns the corner out of his view he catches ANOTHER NAKED WOMAN - an old disgusting one. HAL (CONTD) Yes, fast, fast! He turns away from her in horror only to see AN ENTIRE BLOCK OF NAKED PEOPLE going about their business. He rubs his eyes and looks down the street again. Everyone has returned to a clothed state. 46. He relaxes a little until he looks down and notices that hes floating a foot off the ground. HAL (CONTD) I think I need to go home. INT. HALS APARTMENT - DAY Hals front door CREAKS as it slowly opens, revealing Master Mind. He walks over to the bathroom and smiles to himself as he notices the giant hole in the floor. MASTER MIND Welcome to your second birth, Hal Stewart. Master Mind continues to survey the room. He stops to look over a KARATE KID POSTER on Hals living room wall. He focuses on the majestic image of Pat Morita teaching a young Ralph Macchio to kick. MASTER MIND (CONTD) Instruction is very important in the formative years. Every hero needs a mentor, a father figure to look up to. He presses his special watch, causing his body to MORPH INTO THE SPITTING-IMAGE OF PAT MORITA. PAT MORITA Perfect. INT. HALS APARTMENT - DAY Hal enters, grabs a bottle of vodka from atop of the fridge and takes a long pull from it. VOICE (O.S.) A man will usually find that if he drinks from a bottle, eventually, the bottle drinks from him. Hal does a SPIT TAKE. In the corner a darkened figure stands. HAL Who are you!? 47. VOICE I am the guide on your journey. Fate has chosen you to be its champion. Pat Morita steps out from the shadows. Hal passes out again. LATER We are close on Hals face as his eyes flutter open. He appears to be lying on the couch. He hunches up on his elbows, looks around, but everything is as it seems. He lays his head back down. HAL Thank God. It was a dream. Man, I must be losing it. A voice sounds right next to his ear. PAT MORITA (O.S.) You know youre out of orange juice? Hal leaps up to find hes been resting his head on Pats lap. HAL Jesus! This isnt happening, this isnt happening. Hal backs away and trips over a box. PAT MORITA Calm. All things must be filtered through calmness. HAL Bullshit! Sometimes its best to freak out. PAT MORITA I think we must work on your attitude first. HAL Look Im gonna call the cops in about two seconds if you dont get out of here. 48. Pat rises and walks to Hal. Hes so calm it makes Hal calm. PAT MORITA Are you calm now? HAL Yeah, Im okay. Pat slaps him across the face hard. PAT MORITA Good, because weve got a lot of work to do. Hal grabs his jaw. HAL What the hell was that for? PAT MORITA Rule number one expect the unexpected. HAL Can you just tell me what this is all about? PAT MORITA The heavens are not in the habit of bestowing a gift such as this to just anyone. You are being rewarded for being a man of great moral fortitude with an unwavering belief in humanity. HAL Thats me alright. PAT MORITA I am to train you so you may fulfill your destiny to defeat the great menace to Metro City Master Mind. Pat gets up and walks toward the door. PAT MORITA (CONTD) Come. HAL Were are we going? 49. PAT MORITA To train. EXT. PATS CAR - DAY Pat is sitting in the drivers seat. The car is bumping up and down. PAT MORITA Strength is just as much in the mind as it is the muscle. Remember, both need to be exercised. We PULL BACK to see Hal lifting the car up over his head. Hes hardly straining. HAL IM LIFTING A FREAKING CAR!!! Pat leans on the HORN. PAT MORITA Hey, Corky? You listening? Two highly attractive female joggers run by. Theyre clearly impressed with Hals show of strength. He smiles and mouths a hello. HAL Yeah, work both muscles. EXT. DESERT - DAY Pat cocks back the chamber of a .357 MAGNUM. He holds it up and carefully takes aim...at Hals chest. PAT MORITA Trust me. HAL What are you doing!? PAT MORITA An invulnerability test. Something wrong? HAL Uh...yeah. I would prefer not to get shot. Do not fire that thing! Frustrated, Pat lowers the gun. 50. PAT MORITA Youre bulletproof. HAL Okay, do you know that for sure? Pat quickly aims and fires. Hal lets out a high pitched scream as the bullet ricochets off his chest. PAT MORITA I do now. Hal looks down at his chest, not so much as a scratch. HAL You suck. EXT. SKY - DAY Hal is in the air flying in a sitting position. Hes weaving back and forth. HAL Ice Man, I got a bogie on my tail. Two Russian Migs coming in hard and fast. PAT MORITA Hey! HAL What? Hal looks down to see Pat Morita yelling at him from the roof of a building down below. PAT MORITA What did I tell you? Stomach down, hands up. Hal sighs and assumes the proper superhero in-flight position. HAL God, I feel so gay. Pats CELL PHONE begins to RING. He answers it. PAT MORITA (in Master Mind voice) What is it? 51. ROXANNE (V.O.) John? Pat panics. He looks up to make sure no one is in earshot. He sees Hal now doing somersaults in the air. HAL YEEEE HAWWWW! Pat turns his attention back to the phone, talking in his John Cusack voice. PAT MORITA (in Cusack voice) Yes, its John Cusack. ROXANNE (V.O.) Hi, its Roxanne. Listen, I...I really enjoyed talking with you the other day. PAT MORITA ...As did I. ROXANNE (V.O.) Great. God, I feel really silly, and if you have a lot going on I totally understand. But, I was wondering if you maybe wanted to have lunch. He cant believe what hes hearing. PAT MORITA (excited) Id love to! He quickly recovers his composure. PAT MORITA (CONTD) I mean, I AM a little hungry. ROXANNE (V.O.) Great. How does the park sound, around noon-ish? PAT MORITA Sure! ROXANNE (V.O.) Great, see you then. 52. Pat hangs up the phone and returns it to his pocket as Hal lands behind him. HAL WHOOOOA! Man, that is so cool. Its like fly - Oh my God, I almost said it was like flying. PAT MORITA For the rest of the day I want you to continue to practice your flying posture. HAL Why, wherere ya going? PAT MORITA ...To do something...mysterious ...and Asian. HAL Say no more, bro. Ill just keep at it, then. EXT. PARK - DAY John Cusack and Roxanne eat WRAPPED SANDWICHES while walking through Metro City Park. ROXANNE Hows your sandwich? JOHN CUSACK Its quite delicious. ROXANNE Hope you dont think Im too forward. Some men are intimidated when a woman asks them out. I just find you really easy to talk to. JOHN CUSACK And I you. ROXANNE You know, youre not at all like you are in the movies. JOHN CUSACK Im not? 53. ROXANNE Yeah. I dont know - You have this strange, refined way of speaking. JOHN CUSACK I do? That is most interesting. ROXANNE Anyway, when we were talking the other day I just felt, even though we only talked for a couple of hours, that weve known each other for years. JOHN CUSACK I know just what you mean. Roxanne bites into her sandwich. ROXANNE You know what? This sandwich is disgusting. She tosses it in a nearby garbage can. ROXANNE (CONTD) Of course I already ate half of it. I wonder what that says about my character? JOHN CUSACK It means you dont give up on a sandwich. You see that it has potential, and you give it every chance to be all it can be. Roxanne smiles at his analogy. ROXANNE Thanks, but knowing me, I was probably projecting my expectations of what a lunch should be on the sandwich. It might have been okay at first, but I just made it bitter. John Cusack notices Roxannes smile starting to fade. JOHN CUSACK Is that what happened with your last sandwich - I mean, boyfriend? 54. ROXANNE When I look back, I probably shouldnt of expected so much from him. He was already a giving person. You know, one of those go out and save the world types. JOHN CUSACK Ive run into a few. ROXANNE I was selfish, I guess. I didnt want to share him with anybody else. JOHN CUSACK It sounds like he was a special man. ROXANNE They broke the mold. John Cusack arches his eyebrow in a very familiar manner. JOHN CUSACK Perhaps not. INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY Hal walks up to Pat Morita sporting a Lone Ranger-type mask and wearing a purple and red superhero costume. Its not unlike Ubermans except for a giant T on his chest. (From here on, Hal is referred to as TITAN) TITAN Whats the T stand for? PAT MORITA Titan. TITAN Whats that supposed to mean? PAT MORITA Its from Roman mythology. Zeuss father...oh, just go with it. You look perfect. TITAN I dont think this mask is big enough. Are you sure no one is gonna recognize me? 55. PAT MORITA Its fine, just dont slouch. Its all in the posture. He grabs Titans shoulders like a proud papa. PAT MORITA (CONTD) It is time. INT. BANK - DAY There is a long line of people snaked around the velvet ropes. Theyre all waiting for their chance at the one open teller window. Four men wearing BEATLES MASKS(JOHN,PAUL,GEORGE,AND RINGO)and CARRYING SHOTGUNS enter the bank. John fires a shot in the air, sending everyone into an immediate panic. JOHN Alright folks, this is a robbery. Nobody moves - yadda, yadda, yadda... Ringo jumps over the teller wall and starts stuffing bills into a bag. As John and Paul cover the crowd, George goes to the corner office and puts a gun to the BANK MANAGERS head. GEORGE The safe. Lets go. BANK MANAGER Okay, just dont hurt anyone. GEORGE Yeah, yeah, yeah. George leads him out by the collar. CRASH - Titan smashes through the window and lands in a bold superhero stance with hands on hips. TITAN Well, boys, theres no need for all this just to get the free toaster. Paul cocks his gun. 56. PAUL What are you suppose to be? We move in for a nice dramatic close up. TITAN Justice. GEORGE Well, justice, suck on this... George, John and Paul open fire on Titan. He just stands there and yawns as the bullets bounce off him. With their guns empty the three just stare at him in amazement. TITAN Now its my turn. He turns to George. TITAN (CONTD) Hey, George, here comes the sun. Titan grabs George and throws him into a fluorescent light fixture in the ceiling. Paul tries to run for the door. Titan snatches the collar of his jacket. TITAN (CONTD) Say, Paul, your mother should know...that youre a scumbag. He tosses Paul out the window and into a parked DELIVERY TRUCK. Titan turns around just as John hits him with the butt of his shotgun. It instantly breaks apart in his hands. Titan lifts him like a rag doll up into the air. TITAN (CONTD) John, all you need is love... He throws John who lands on top of a cubical wall - GROIN FIRST. TITAN (CONTD) ...and a good urologist. 57. Titan effortlessly hops over the teller wall to find Ringo cowering on the floor. He grabs him by the shirt and lifts him up. HAL Well, Ringo...um...um...youre under arrest. EXT. BANK - DAY Titan walks out of the bank with Ringo and George under his arm. Hes suddenly swarmed by a group of television reporters, including Roxanne. Across the street is Pat Morita. He watches Titans first news conference with great anxiety. BANK MANAGER (to Hal) On behalf of the First National Bank of Metro City, Id like to offer you a reward for your act of bravery. He hands Titan a check. TITAN (reading) Ten thousand dollars! Titan looks over to Pat, who violently shakes his head no. TITAN (CONTD) (unenthusiastically) I...cant except this. Law and order is its own...um...reward. Pat gives him the thumbs up. Pat turns, suddenly seeing Roxanne with her camera crew. Captivated, his eyes lock on her. Meanwhile, Roxanne and her cameraman, SETH, are maneuvering around the crowd to get closer to Titan. BRAD HELMS (O.S.) Not so fast, Roxanne. They both turn to see Roxannes reporter rival Brad Helms, Geraldo without the class, and his cameraman, FRANK. BRAD HELMS This storys mine. 58. ROXANNE Listen, Brad. We were just in the area. I was just trying to - BRAD HELMS Ive been in this business long enough to know pretty well what you were just trying to do. Besides, I heard you couldnt take the big game anymore and were put on fluff detail? Dejected, Roxanne turns and motions for Seth to turn the camera off. SETH Youre not gonna take that from him, are you? ROXANNE Hes right. Old habit, I guess. (to Brad) Well get out of your way. As they walk off, Brad makes a comment to Frank loud enough for her to hear. BRAD HELMS Besides, Im sure theres a pancake supper somewhere that needs covering. INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY - OFFICE - DAY ON TELEVISION We see the news conference on the banks steps. In the corner of the screen is written recorded earlier. BRAD HELMS For months now, since the death of Uberman, the citizens of Metro City have been holding out for a hero. Well, it appears they wont have to hold out for much longer as a new costumed crusader has suddenly stormed onto the scene. Today, at the Metro Savings and Trust, a masked mystery man single-handedly defeated The Fab Four Gang. Just who is this new caped avenger? Brad holds the microphone to Titans face. 59. BRAD HELMS Im sure all of our viewers are now wondering, whats the T stand for? TITAN Its a message to all the scum out there. Uberman may be gone, but Metro City has a new protector, and his name is Tighten! Another reporter leans in. REPORTER How do you spell that? We PULL BACK to see Plato and Da Vinci watching this spectacle. Master Mind is sitting with them, reading a NEWSPAPER. MASTER MIND (reading paper) Oh, for heavens sake. I cant believe it. He misspelled his name. Master Mind holds up the newspaper. The headline reads Metros New Hero Tighten. MASTER MIND (CONTD) No matter, I suppose. Master Mind throws the paper on the floor and begins to pace around the room with his arms folded behind his back. MASTER MIND (CONTD) Weve now fully established Titan as Metro Citys hero. They will love him just as they loved Uberman. Everything is going according to plan. Einstein leans over and whispers in Platos ear. EINSTEIN (whispering) Yeah, if the plan is getting us in jail. Master Mind turns around, facing Einstein. He walks over, standing face to face with the rebellious henchmen. 60. MASTER MIND You know, Einstein, maybe I should have called you Socrates. He also didnt know when to keep his thoughts to himself. EINSTEIN I just fail to see the point in all of this. I mean, why are we creating another superhero when it was such a pain in the ass for you to get rid of the other one? I mean, Uberman is destroyed, we should be using this opportunity to...to... MASTER MIND To what? EINSTEIN I dont know. To take over the weather, space, the world - whatever super villains are SUPPOSED to do. MASTER MIND The reason someone like you will always be a minion is because you have no foresight. We take over the earth, like you said. Then what? Women? Cars? Money? Even the grandest treasures will lose their lustre if you dont have someone to hold them over. Einstein throws up his hands. Hes had enough. He pulls off his wig and throws it to the floor. EINSTEIN Thats it! This balance of the force bullshit is getting way too Oprah for me. Im blowing. Whos with me? MASTER MIND You dare? EINSTEIN Yeah, I dare. Im sick of wearing stupid costumes, and Im sick of working for a super villain whos turning into a softie. 61. Plato and Da Vincis mouths drop to the floor. They turn to Master Mind for his rebuttal. MASTER MIND What - did - you - call me? EINSTEIN You heard me. You used to be an inhuman monster, now look at you. Youre creating super heroes, you dont go with us on robberies anymore, its been days since you threatened anyone, oh, and not to mention this Roxanne Ritchi thing. MASTER MIND THAT is none of your business, knave! EINSTEIN Hey, you guys havent sealed the deal yet, have you? MASTER MIND Silence! EINSTEIN (In a womans voice) Oh, Master, your head is so big. MASTER MIND Im warning you, Einstein. EINSTEIN (In a womans voice) Take me! MASTER MIND I said silence! With his metal gauntlet Master Mind grabs Einstein by the throat and lifts him into the air. Einstein looks frightened as he tries to pry himself free of Master Minds grip. Master Minds eyes soften as if his heart is suddenly not into what hes about to do. He lets Einstein drop to the floor. MASTER MIND (CONTD) Get out of my sight. 62. EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT Roxanne and John Cusack are eating on the outside patio of a fancy restaurant. ROXANNE Dont get me wrong, I love being a reporter. I dont think I could do anything else. Its the consequences of what we do that Im having a problem with. He listens intently as he refills her glass with wine. JOHN CUSACK Thats where journalistic responsibility comes in, no? ROXANNE Its supposed to. JOHN CUSACK Sounds to me like youre running from something. ROXANNE I got someone I cared about killed. If it wasnt for me, he wouldnt have been involved. John suddenly gets a disturbed look in his eye, realizing what shes talking about. He reaches across the table and takes her hand. JOHN CUSACK You cant blame yourself. My father used to say each of us must answer the great call to truly feel alive. ROXANNE Was he an actor? JOHN CUSACK ...No. He was...a landscaper. And a horrible one. I mean he would fail time and time again at his...landscaping. And sometimes hed get pretty beaten up or thrown in jail - ROXANNE Jail? 63. JOHN CUSACK My point is he took the good with the bad. He grew a little each time. Improved, learned. ROXANNE Was he ever successful? JOHN CUSACK God, no...but dont let deter you. Roxanne LAUGHS. ROXANNE Thanks for this. You know, this is embarrassing, but its been a long time since I - Its starting to lightly sprinkle. Roxanne looks up. ROXANNE (CONTD) I think its starting to rain. We might want to find a table inside. JOHN CUSACK What were you gonna say? ROXANNE Oh, I was gonna say...Its been a long time since...well, Ive been with someone I...enjoy being with. John Cusack smiles warmly and raises his glass for a toast. JOHN CUSACK To people who enjoy being with each other. They go to clang glasses, when the rain suddenly causes John Cusacks disguise generator to short. His true form of Master Mind is briefly revealed to Roxanne as a BOLT OF ELECTRICITY encircles his body. Roxanne drops her glass and jumps out of her seat. MASTER MIND (CONTD) Oh, no. Dont look at me. LIKE A BROKEN TV the image keeps switching between MASTER MIND AND JOHN CUSACK. 64. As Master Mind starts to franticly slap at his watch, the Cusack disguise begins to hold steady. He nonchalantly returns to cutting his steak. JOHN CUSACK Okay, never mind that. Now, where were we? Roxanne grabs his glass and throws the drink in his face, causing the generator to short out permanently. Master Mind now sits in his true blue form. ROXANNE Oh my God. MASTER MIND Youre not gonna get all freaky about this, are you? ROXANNE This...this is too much, even for you. God, I go out with you, tell you my innermost thoughts. MASTER MIND I only did this because I wanted to talk to you on the same level. You know, without all the baggage? ROXANNE Baggage? You burned my boyfriend alive, you sick son-of-a-bitch! MASTER MIND You see, thats exactly what Im talking about. Roxanne starts to walk away. MASTER MIND (CONTD) Roxanne! ROXANNE Stay away from me. Master Mind sinks back down to his chair. Despite the now heavy rain bombarding him, he returns to his food. Several resturaunt patrons are looking at him through the window. 65. Our villain turns to them, giving them a villainous glare. MASTER MIND What? INT. MASTER MINDS BEDROOM - NIGHT Master Mind is lying on his back, wide awake. MASTER MIND (mumbling to himself) Stupid. What was I thinking? Plato, its his fault. Hes the one who sent me on this weak-willed path. Ill filet his scrotum for this. Me, a creature of evil, in love with Roxanne Ritchi. Preposterous. I hardly give such matters thought He rolls onto his side. He yawns and closes his eyes. Suddenly, they shoot back open. CUT TO EXT. ROXANNES APARTMENT - NIGHT Master Mind pulls up in a blue Rolls Royce, across the street from Roxannes apartment He stares up at the building, hoping to catch a glimpse of her. Finally, she appears, primping her hair in her apartment windows reflection. MASTER MIND I should just go up there and just lay it all out to her. Roxanne, I like you - I always have. Oh, and Im sorry I blew up your ex. (realizing the absurdity of his words) Yeah, that would go over like a pants-less clown at a childs birthday party. What the hell am I even doing here? Who cares what she thinks? Im a supervillain and here I am acting like a love struck schoolboy. Forget this. I control my own destiny! 66. He turns the ignition key - NOTHING HAPPENS. He repeats but gets the same results. MASTER MIND (CONTD) (disgusted) Perfect. INT. ROXANNES APARTMENT - NIGHT She pulls a pack of smokes off her night stand. Empty. ROXANNE Damn. She grabs her long coat and throws it over her robe. EXT. ROXANNES APARTMENT BUILDING Roxanne steps outside. ROXANNE Please be open. Across the street is a liquor store. The light is still on. ROXANNE (CONTD) Thank God. She walks across the street, passing in front of Master Minds car. Spotting her, he sinks down in his seat. Roxanne walks by, totally unaware of his presence. Relieved, Master Mind sits back up and watches her go into the store. INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT Roxanne walks up to an elderly Korean SHOPKEEPER at the counter. ROXANNE A pack of Lady Strikes, please. EXT. MASTER MINDS CAR - NIGHT Master Mind is talking on his cell phone. MASTER MIND Hello, Triple A? 67. He suddenly spots something across the street. EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT A HOODLUM walks up to the entrance of the store and pulls out a gun from under his coat. EXT. MASTER MINDS CAR - NIGHT Master Mind stares in shock. MASTER MIND Ill call you back. He hangs up the phone and watches the Hoodlum go inside the store. INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT The Hoodlum reaches across the counter and grabs a fist full of cash from the register. SHOPKEEPER Hey! SHOTGUN HOODLUM Shut up, Gramps. He turns to Roxanne, spotting a GOLD NECKLACE around her neck. SHOTGUN HOODLUM (CONTD) Gimme that necklace! ROXANNE I dont think so. The Hoodlum cocks his shotgun. SHOTGUN HOODLUM I said give it to me! MASTER MIND (O.S.) The lady said no. The hoodlum turns around to see Master Mind in the doorway holding a STRANGE-LOOKING HAND CANNON (GOO GUN) with knobs and blinking lights. The hoodlum starts to laugh. 68. SHOTGUN HOODLUM What the hells that? A super soaker? MASTER MIND No, its a goo gun. The hoodlum turns his gun to Master Mind. SHOTGUN HOODLUM Yeah, whats it do? MASTER MIND It goos. Master Mind fires the cannon. It instantly covers the store in a cloud of SMOKE. The smoke clears to reveal the hoodlum STUCK TO THE WALL, covered in a thick, GREEN GUNK. Roxanne stares at him, dumbfounded. MASTER MIND (CONTD) Its...a prototype. Master Mind starts to walk out when hes suddenly confronted by the shopkeeper. SHOPKEEPER I know you! You Master Brain guy. You a hero. Master Mind points the goo gun at him. MASTER MIND Dont - EVER - say that again. EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT Master Mind walks out with the cannon resting on his shoulder like hes a short timer in Da Nang. Roxanne follows shortly behind him. ROXANNE Hey! Master Mind turns around. ROXANNE (CONTD) Are you following me or something? 69. MASTER MIND Dont flatter yourself. He turns away and continues walking. Roxanne runs in front of him blocking his way. ROXANNE Dont walk away from me when Im talking to you. Finally it occurs to her whats going on. ROXANNE (CONTD) What a minute...all that stuff you use to say to me when Uberman was alive - about me being the loyal queen by your side as you rule over Metro City. That wasnt just super villain rhetoric, was it? You actually meant it! MASTER MIND My, someone has a rather high opinion of themselves. They stare at each other in silence, their glares locked in conflict. ROXANNE (coldly) Do you really think I would be with someone like you? This stings Master Mind to the bone. And after a brief contemplation, he reaches the only logical, painful conclusion. MASTER MIND No. With that, Master Mind exits into the night, leaving Roxanne with a baffled expression on her face. INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY - NIGHT Master Mind enters in a huff. Da Vinci closes the door behind him as Plato notices his masters agitated state. PLATO Everything alright, sir? Master Mind GRABS PLATO BY THE GROIN with his metal gauntlet causing Platos eyes to bulge in pain. 70. MASTER MIND (overly calm) Fine, why do you ask? PLATO You...just...seem... Master Mind tightens his grip. MASTER MIND Go on. PLATO ...distracted. Master Mind releases him. MASTER MIND Just with business, my minion. Just with business. Ive decided it is time. PLATO You mean? MASTER MIND Yes, weve created our hero, now its time to give him a little motivation. DA VINCI How do we do that? MASTER MIND To be simply good is not enough. A hero must be driven by an almost relentless desire to right a wrong that can never be corrected. PLATO You mean? MASTER MIND Yes, he must lose someone near and dear to him - his father figure. Gentlemen, its time for Operation Mentor Kill! EXT. SKY OVER METRO CITY - DAY Titan flies high over and through the city, under bridges, between buildings, etc. Hes not really working, just enjoying himself. 71. INT. WOMANS APARTMENT - NIGHT A PRETTY WOMAN sits at her makeup table wearing nothing but her bra and panties. Through the reflection in her mirror we see a large window directly behind her. As she applies lipstick we see Titan fly quickly by in the background. After a moment he slowly slides back in view and begins ogling the girl. She sees him in the mirror and quickly covers herself with a robe. Titan tries to hide his face as he zooms off. MOMENTS LATER Titan looks down to see an APARTMENT BUILDING IN RUIN. Emergency lights flash around it as swarms of people run around in chaos. TITAN Man, what the hell happened down there? Wait a sec - He stops in mid-air as he comes to the striking realization. TITAN (CONTD) THATS MY APARTMENT!!! EXT. HALS APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY Titan lands in front of the rubble that was once his home. Reporters stand just beyond the police line. TITAN Crap. From the wreckage crawls a dying Pat Morita. TITAN (CONTD) PAT! Titan goes and kneels beside Pat, holding him in his arms. TITAN (CONTD) You okay? PAT MORITA Im dying, kid. There is just one last lesson I have for you. It is the most important of all. 72. TITAN Whats that? PAT MORITA Master Mind did this, you must avenge me. TITAN Master Mind? Why? PAT MORITA Because hes evil. You must stop the evil Hal - stop the... Pats body goes limp. The cameras begin to pop and flash around them. Titan gently lays Pats body down and stands respectfully over him. The reporters rush over. REPORTER 1 Tighten, Is this the work of Master Mind? REPORTER 2 How will the death of your mentor affect your resolve? REPORTER 3 Was that Pat Morita? Titan walks up to one of the cameras. TITAN This injustice will not go unpunished. Master Mind, if you can hear me, Tighten is coming for you. In the background we see Plato and Da Vinci, DRESSED AS PARAMEDICS, load pats body onto a stretcher. PLATO ACCIDENTALLY DROPS HIS SIDE. As he bends down to pick it back up, Pat quickly slaps him, then goes back to playing dead. INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY - NIGHT Master Mind and the boys prepare the fortress for Hals revenge attack. Master Mind is as giddy as a schoolboy. 73. MASTER MIND Alright, people, we dont have much time. Titan should be here any minute, so lets get the lead out. There is a GIANT MOUNTED DEATH RAY in the middle of the hall being tinkered with by Da Vinci. MASTER MIND (CONTD) Hows the death ray coming? DA VINCI Nearly up to full power, sir. MASTER MIND Hum. Lets turn it down a few notches. Its his first time and we dont want to get in a lucky shot, now do we? Plato enters the room. MASTER MIND (CONTD) Anything on the radar yet? PLATO Not yet, sir. MASTER MIND I see. Well, he must be planning something big. Are the flame androids deployed? PLATO All twelve. Master Mind rubs his hands in anticipation as he sits down on his throne. MASTER MIND Wonderful, wonderful. Plato, Da Vinci, take your places next to me. They move to either side of the chair. MASTER MIND (CONTD) No slouching. Da Vinci straightens up and sucks in his gut. They remain this way for several long moments. Master Mind occasionally glances at a DIGITAL CLOCK on the wall. Still no Titan. 74. LATER Apparently quite some time has passed. The bold stances have degraded to fatigue. PLATO Hes certainly taking his time. MASTER MIND Hell be here. Thats the way it works. STILL LATER Master Mind reclines in his chair and taps his metal gauntlet impatiently on the armrest. Plato has squatted down, resting his chin on his hand. MASTER MIND (CONTD) Unprofessional, thats what this is. No, its disrespect for the craft. Master Mind rises and begins to pace back and forth. MASTER MIND (CONTD) Would Uberman have kept us waiting like this? Of course not. He was a pro who knew the score. Its time we spelled out a few things for this Titan. I will not be made a fool of. He storms out of the room. INT. HALS NEW APARTMENT - DAY Titans sitting on the floor in a barren apartment wearing his costume top and some tighty whities. He sips his beer as he watches a basketball game on a tiny TV. Much to his annoyance, theres a KNOCK at the door. TITAN Oh, for crying out loud. He gets up and opens the door. Its Master Mind. MASTER MIND Do you know who I am? 75. It takes a few moments to register, but Titans suddenly excited. TITAN Yeah, youre Master Mind. Yeah! Youre actually the guy I want to see! MASTER MIND Oh, so NOW you want to get down to it. Well, I want to get a few things off my chest first. Master Mind walks past Titan into the apartment. He spins around, pointing at him accusingly with one of his metal fingers. MASTER MIND (CONTD) Of all the inconsiderate - Do you have any idea how long we waited for you? Were you even planning on coming to me and getting revenge? Titan shuts the apartment door, and turns back toward his guest. TITAN Well, at first I was going to. You know, because thats what I figured I was supposed to do. But then I got to thinking- MASTER MIND (interrupting) -You got to thinking? Theres nothing to think about. Im the villain. I do something bad, you come and get me. TITAN - I got to thinking...whats the point? Master Mind throws up his hands. MASTER MIND Maybe youre right. Whats the point? He suddenly notices something in the corner of his eye. He walks over to a futon in the living room. On top of it is a LARGE SACK OVERFLOWING WITH GOLD WATCHES,RINGS AND OTHER VALUABLES. 76. MASTER MIND (CONTD) What are these? TITAN Thats what I wanted to talk to you about. MASTER MIND (baffled) Where did you get all this? TITAN (proudly) Get this I stole them. MASTER MIND From where? TITAN From all over. You see, once you killed Pat and ruined my other apartment building I was pretty pissed off, so I figured Id go, find you and kick some ass. Then I thought to myself Okay,then what? I mean, if we were to fight, what would I get out of it? Would I get my apartment back? Would I be able to pay the bills? MASTER MIND Well, what about your mentor? TITAN Tell you the truth? He was kind of a dick. I mean, being a hero is dandy and all, but its volunteer work. Now youve always had the right take on all this. I mean, when you rob a bank or take over the diamond exchange you get something out of it. I mean, when you dont get caught, which, no offense, isnt very often. And that brings me to what I wanted to propose to you Who could catch you if Im by your side? Perplexed by his proposal, Master Mind just stares at Titan awe-struck. MASTER MIND You want to team-up? 77. TITAN You got the brains, I got the brawn. We could even call ourselves that Brain and Brawn. Look at this. Titan picks up a piece of POSTER BOARD off the floor and shows it to Master Mind. TITAN (CONTD) I even designed us some new costumes. The picture is crudely drawn with magic markers and crayons. A big headed man (Master Mind) is standing on a plate of grass in a blue costume with a picture of a brain on his chest. Next to him, is a picture of Titan in a red costume with a black cape, but his chest is mysteriously blank. Titan proudly points to the two figures. TITAN (CONTD) See, youd be brain, so you got a little one on your costume, and then Ill have brawn on mine...once I figure out the best, you know, visual interpretation of it. What do you think? MASTER MIND What do I think? Master Mind shakes his head tiredly. MASTER MIND (CONTD) I think youre probably the biggest idiot Ive ever met. I mean, I cant believe you. All your gifts, all your powers, and all you want to use them for is your own financial fulfillment. You know what? Your kind of people make me sick. Titan puts down his drawing. TITAN I worked hard on this. MASTER MIND Oh - gee - I am so sorry! 78. Master Mind looks to Heaven in disgust. MASTER MIND (CONTD) (under his breath) Of all the people to pick, it had to be this loser. This strikes a cord with Titan. TITAN Now, hold on. Youre going a little too far. MASTER MIND I wish your mother said that to your father the night of your conception, they would have saved me a whole lot of heartache. TITAN Hey, I mean it. Master Mind gets right in his face. MASTER MIND Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do? EXT. HALS APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY We see Master Minds body CRASH through the building and land in a DUMPSTER across the street. A car pulls up. The drivers door opens. Da Vinci gets out and runs to help his master. DA VINCI Master! MASTER MIND (O.S.) It hurts. Da Vinci peeks into the dumpster to see Master Minds body cushioned by a stack of trash bags. DA VINCI What hurts? MASTER MIND It! The overly large henchmen starts to pull his master from the dumpster when they suddenly hear a voice from above. Its Titan peeking through the hole in his apartment wall. 79. TITAN I dont need you, I dont need anybody. I have the power to do and take anything I want. And now, Im gonna take back everything this city owes me. Beware Metro City, its time for Titan to collect. Titan shoots up into the air. TITAN (CONTD) Oh, and from now on - IM GONNA FLY THE WAY I WANT TO FLY! He takes a sitting position and flies away as if he were piloting an invisible jet. Master Mind climbs out of the dumpster and watches Titan disappear into the distance. DA VINCI Howd the plan go, boss? MASTER MIND I just made myself redundant, old friend. Da Vinci gives Master Mind a whiff. DA VINCI Its not that bad. INT. BANK - DAY Titan, with a happy bounce in his step, enters the bank. The last time he was here he thwarted a robbery. He looks nostalgic. A SECURITY GUARD shyly walks up to him like a kid meeting his TV idol. SECURITY GUARD Morning, Tighten. TITAN Morning. SECURITY GUARD Is there something we can do for you? 80. TITAN Oh, dont bother about me. Im just here to make a withdrawal. Titan walks across the lobby, drawing stares of admiration from all. A little girl waves to him sweetly. He gives her a good- natured WINK as he heads straight for the vault. The security guard watches him enter and come out with a SACK OF CASH. Sure he must be misunderstanding whats going on, the security guard just stares at Titan as he passes by and out the door. The bank manager comes over to the guard. BANK MANAGER Say, did he just rob us? SECURITY GUARD Not sure. Sort of looks it, dont it? BANK MANAGER Yeah. SECURITY GUARD Should I, you know, stop him? BANK MANAGER Umm...Yeah. As the security guard exits the bank, the manager stares out the window. His eyes suddenly grow wide with terror. The guards body suddenly smashes through the window, landing at the startled bank managers feet. BANK MANAGER (CONTD) (looking down at the guard) He did rob us, didnt he? CUT TO TELEVISION A Channel 7 News Special Report. Brad Helms wipes into view. 81. BRAD HELMS Absolute power corrupts absolutely. When Lord Acton stated that, in a letter to Bishop Mandell Creighton in 1887, no one thought much about it, but today Metro City is reeling from that very prophecy. Tighten, who many thought of as our savior, has turned his back on the cause of justice. CUT TO TITAN BEING EVIL - MONTAGE EXT. DIAMOND EXCHANGE - DAY Titan flies through the window of the building. He emerges seconds later laughing with his shirt full of booty. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY A woman screams from the window of a BURNING BUILDING. Titan flies up to her, grabs her fur coat and zooms off again, leaving the woman behind, slightly confused. EXT. OUTSIDE MARKET - DAY Titan steals a little boys lollipop and gooses his mother. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY Dozens of people run through the streets apparently to get out of a downpour. We cut to the top of a building and see Titan ZIPPING UP HIS PANTS and laughing. INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY - NIGHT Master Mind paces back and forth in front of Plato and Da Vinci. PLATO I dont understand it. He seemed to have every characteristic we were looking for in a superhero. MASTER MIND Well, theres no use crying about it now, we must take action. Im not going to play second fiddle to that crass buffoon. We must destroy Tighten. 82. PLATO It wont be easy. Uberman had a sense of decency and genuine love for the people. That was his weakness and was easily used against him. MASTER MIND Yes, but he possesses the same flaws present in Ubermans DNA - copper. Its like Benjamin Franklin always said If something works dont dick with it. EXT. BAR - DAY It looks like a war zone passed through here. Smashed police cars and debris lay everywhere. This seems to be the only building left untouched. INT. BAR - DAY A very tipsy Titan is sitting at the bar, looking deep into the bottom of his beer glass for answers. TITAN I can have anything I want. Im like a god. The BARTENDER just listens as he wipes down a glass with a dirty rag. TITAN Point to any woman in this bar. I could have her in a second. He follows the bartenders gaze to THE ONLY OTHER PERSON THERE - A passed out, MIDDLE AGED HAG OF A BARFLY. TITAN (to Old Barfly) Hey, you wanna get with this? BARTENDER Buddy, what do you want? Titan carefully considers this for a moment. TITAN What do you want? Thats the question, isnt it. I mean, what do you want when you can have everything? (MORE) 83. TITAN(contd) I suppose what I really want is to never be forgotten again. I want to do something that can never be cast aside or one-upped. I want a - whats it called? - A legacy. I want a legacy. Yeah, thats it. I like the sound that. BARTENDER I meant, what do you want to drink? TITAN Oh. EXT. BAR - LATER Titan stumbles out of the bar, carrying a large sack of money. MASTER MIND (O.S.) Your time has come to an end, Titan! He looks up to see Master Mind suddenly standing before him. TITAN What? MASTER MIND There can be only one master criminal in this city - and its me. TITAN Really? Titan melodramatically throws up his arms. TITAN (CONTD) I guess I should leave town then, huh? MASTER MIND I have a better idea - NOW! Two floors up Da Vinci releases a rope. A COPPER CAGE, like the one that caged Uberman, drops down on top of Titan. Titan nonchalantly surveys the cage. He walks to the bars, tries to pull them apart but cant. MASTER MIND (CONTD) Thats copper my good man. Your one weakness. (MORE) 84. MASTER MIND(contd) For all your amazing gifts of brawn you are no match for my intellect. Titan thinks for a moment. Suddenly, he starts to SPIN like a human top, DRILLING HIMSELF INTO THE STREET BELOW. As he disappears beneath the surface, we see a shocked look on Master Minds face until Titan suddenly explodes out from under the street in front of him. Master Mind stares up at him, dumbfounded. Titan makes like hes going to strike him down, but stops. TITAN You know what? Youre nothing but a bug. Not even worth my effort. He turns his back to Master Mind and continues down the street. Plato makes his way from the shadows to join his master. They watch Titan shrink into the distance. MASTER MIND Hes not as dumb as I thought. PLATO I guess not...Funny, though. MASTER MIND Whats funny? PLATO Funny Uberman didnt think of the same thing. EXT. HIGH ABOVE METRO CITY - DAY As Titan flies, he looks down at the rooftops of the city below. Suddenly, something catches his attention. HAL Thats it! He stops, hovering in place as he looks down below. The buildings, which make up the heart of downtown Metro, are in a PERFECT TRIANGLE with a long strip of street leading up to it. It sorta looks like a bowling lane. 85. HAL Hello, Legacy. EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY Vinnie and his goons come running out as the hear a COMMOTION. They look up to see Titan ripping off THE GIANT BOWLING BALL from the top of the establishment. VINNIE Hey, thats my ball! INT. ROXANNES APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY Roxanne enters the buildings elevator. Just before the door closes an ELDERLY WOMAN slides in. ELDERLY WOMAN That was a close one. Sixth floor, please. Roxanne smiles and goes to press the button. The elderly woman suddenly pulls out a SPRAY CAN, shooting a MYSTERIOUS-LOOKING MIST into Roxannes face. She falls to the floor unconscious. INT. ROXANNES APARTMENT - DAY Roxanne awakens, finding herself tied to a chair in her living room. We hear NOISE from a TV in the background as she tries to adjust her vision. Slowly, the blurry figure before her becomes clear. Its Master Mind. He sits on her Lazy-Boy, reading what looks to be some kind of JOURNAL. MASTER MIND Wow, I always thought Uberman was your first superhero - but it looks like our little Roxanne dated a linebacker in college. ROXANNE Thats my diary. MASTER MIND So it is. 86. ROXANNE Its personal. MASTER MIND Well, then I wouldnt leave it in your underwear drawer for just anyone to find. He throws the diary over his shoulder. ROXANNE What do you want? MASTER MIND I need your help. ROXANNE So you knock me out and tie me to a chair? MASTER MIND Youre not going to like what Im about to tell you. As she tries to shake off her headache from being knocked unconscious, Roxanne spots something on the TV. ON TELEVISION Brad Helms is huddled behind a van. BRAD HELMS Its chaos here in city square as city police - Behind him, Titan picks up a POLICE CAR and throws it at a PADDY WAGON. Both vehicles EXPLODE on impact. BACK TO SCENE ROXANNE Hes really out of control. MASTER MIND Tell me about it. As if finally realizing something, Roxanne looks back at Master Mind. ROXANNE I should have known. You have something to do with this, dont you? - With Titan turning evil. 87. MASTER MIND Well, the evil thing he did by himself. My goal was to give MYSELF purpose by creating an intellectual sparring partner. ROXANNE (confused) Youre talking like you made him. MASTER MIND And they call me Master Mind. ROXANNE Let me get this straight. You missed getting your ass kicked, so you made a new guy to kick your ass. Thats pathetic. MASTER MIND In hindsight... Roxanne turns back to the TV to see a group of POLICE OFFICERS open fire on Titan. The bullets just deflect off his chest. ROXANNE And his powers, theyre just like Ubermans. Why would he have his powers? MASTER MIND (almost ashamed) I had some left over from something. I infused him with it. ROXANNE YOU DID WHAT!? Driven by rage, she struggles to tear out of her bonds. She finally relents, giving Master Mind a look fueled by pure hatred. MASTER MIND Yeah, thats why I decided to tie you up. ROXANNE You did all this because you wanted purpose? MASTER MIND He seemed nice. 88. TELEVISION Titan is standing on top of a destroyed police car. He waves for the camera to zoom in on him. TITAN Closer. I want to show the people my real face. He pulls off his mask, revealing himself as Hal Stewart to the public for the first time. TITAN (CONTD) Recognize me? BACK TO SCENE ROXANNE Hal Stewart. Hes the guy we thought saved that woman and kid. Turned out he was just trying to save his own ass. MASTER MIND Yeah, good to know - NOW! TELEVISION Titan throws the mask over this shoulder and hops off the car. TITAN Thats right, Im really Hal Stewart. Former hero and bowling teacher at Kingpins Bowling. BACK TO SCENE Roxanne turns to Master Mind, condescending him with her eyes. ROXANNE You picked a bowler to give super powers to? MASTER MIND Its a modest profession! TELEVISION 89. TITAN With my new found power, Ive recently started to wonder what sort of legacy I should leave. Should I be a hero? I tried that once before - even saved a lady and her baby from being squashed. I was treated like a god until everyone started to shit on me - Okay, so what if I didnt purposely save them! He walks over and puts his hand on a large circular concrete shape just off camera. TITAN Well, Im going to make something that cant be taken away from me. Im going to create a permanent monument to my greatness. One that wont be so easily forgotten or erased. The camera pulls back revealing THE GIANT CONCRETE BOWLING BALL from Kingpins. TITAN I intend to create a new category in the Guinness Book of Worlds Records by rolling the biggest strike in the history of bowling. He grabs the camera and points it to the DOWNTOWN BUILDINGS. We realize they are PERFECTLY ALIGNED IN BOWLING PIN FORMATION. TITAN My thanks to the city planning commission. This wouldnt have been possible without them. Titan grabs the camera so its pointing back at him again. TITAN Tell your friends and family to tune in right here to this station at noon tomorrow. BACK TO SCENE ROXANNE My god, hes nuts. Thatll destroy the whole business triangle. 90. Master Mind seems to be contemplating something - something bad. ROXANNE What? MASTER MIND My lair is in the direct path of the ball. ROXANNE Oh, real nice. Wouldnt want anything to happen to your hideout, would we? MASTER MIND You dont understand. I have certain equipment thats - thats highly unstable. ROXANNE What do you mean? MASTER MIND I sort of have a hydrogen reactor, okay? ROXANNE A HYDROGEN reactor? MASTER MIND Its experimental - only one in the world...Well, how do you think I power all my inventions? Someone like me cant pay for electricity. The bills would be outrageous. ROXANNE A REACTOR? MASTER MIND It creates 100 times the output of a nuclear one...If destroyed it could... ROXANNE - Vaporize the entire city! MASTER MIND (proudly) Pshaw...the whole eastern seaboard, actually. That little baby is amazing. Im quite proud of it. (MORE) 91. MASTER MIND(contd) (off her deadpan reaction) I mean...wed better find a way to stop him. Master Mind thinks a moment. MASTER MIND Did Uberman have a hideout? ROXANNE What? MASTER MIND A cave, a solitary fortress of some kind. Cmon, all heros have a place to hang their capes up in. Roxanne, it may be our only chance to find something, a clue, anything that could give us a fighting chance. ROXANNE Its under his house. MASTER MIND Whose house? Roxanne can hardly believe what shes telling him. ROXANNE Wayne Scotts. Master Mind shoots up out of his chair. MASTER MIND Wayne Scott? Uberman was Wayne Scott!? Wayne Scott, the wealthy philanthropist? But he disappeared - ROXANNE (interrupting) He disappeared just over two months ago when you killed him. Not only did you rid the world of a hero, you killed a kind, noble, generous man. Perhaps ashamed, the super villain hangs his head. Master Mind walks behind Roxanne and undoes her bonds. Rubbing her wrists, she watches him as he walks over to the door. 92. ROXANNE (CONTD) Looks like you got what you always wanted. Uberman is out of the picture and Metro City is doomed. He grabs the door knob and stops, considering her words. MASTER MIND Metro City doomed. You know, I never thought Id say something like this, but here it goes - He slowly turns to her, CUE HEROIC MUSIC. MASTER MIND (CONTD) Not if I have anything to say about it. EXT. WAYNE SCOTTS MANSION - NIGHT Master Mind stands before the huge, Gothic structure in awe. MASTER MIND Such a dark place for one such as you. I wonder, underneath your noble deeds, what inner demons drove you to your endless crusade for justice? He walks to the front entrance. The double doors have been sealed shut with boards and nails. Master Mind begins to tear them off with his metal hand. INT. WAYNE SCOTTS MANSION - NIGHT The doors opens. A beam of moonlight immediately pierces the darkness, forming an illuminated path into the heart of the manor. Master Mind enters. Covered in dust and cobwebs, the hall looks like a gigantic crypt. MASTER MIND Good lord, man. Youve only been dead for two months. Master Mind walks, coming to a gigantic painted PORTRAIT OF WAYNE SCOTT. He stops to reverently admire the image of his fallen foe. 93. MASTER MIND (CONTD) A disguise so simple, its ingenious. No wonder I never caught on. Besides the Armani suit, theres nothing to hide the fact that this is the same person as Uberman. In the picture, hes even standing in the same cheesy, heroic pose with his fists on his hips. MASTER MIND (CONTD) Two lives, yet in both you were an ideal. Perhaps it was you who was victorious in the end, old friend. A BONGING sound suddenly bellows through the dark halls. Master Mind comes to a grandfather clock standing next to a gigantic BOOKCASE. On the twelfth bong it falls silent. Master Mind begins to slide it across the floor until he hears a loud CLICK. The bookcase slides into the wall, REVEALING A HIDDEN PASSAGE. MASTER MIND (CONTD) Ill miss how predictable you were. The passage way leads Master Mind to a WORKING ESCALATOR. Master Mind gets off the escalator to see a long hallway with stone walls. He begins to hear strange SOUNDS, almost like MUFFLED SCREAMS, coming from a doorway at the end of the hallway. Master Mind starts walking towards it. As he steps closer, he begins to notice a light cracking through the bottom of the door. MASTER MIND (CONTD) Hello? Anyone here...besides..all the BIG MEN who are with me now? Nothing. MASTER MIND (CONTD) (to himself) Whats the worst youre gonna find? (MORE) 94. MASTER MIND(contd) The man was a boy scout, not a serial killer. He opens the door to his immediate amazement. Its some kind of screening room. A PROJECTOR shoots an image onto A DIRTY WHITE SCREEN hanging on the wall. BEER CANS litter the floor a table in front of a ripped-up couch is covered in discarded snack goods and a Kiss Pinball machine stands in the far corner next to a CLOSED DOOR. Master Mind turns his attention to the action on the screen. SCREEN A woman dressed in a leather DOMINATRIX OUTFIT is whipping an overweight man lying on a swing-like device with his butt sticking out. DOMINATRIX IN FILM YOU ARE A WORM! She whips him three times. The man CRIES out in pain. FAT MAN IN FILM PINEAPPLE!!! PINEAPPLE!!! Master Minds eyes are transfixed on the disturbing imagery. The door by the pinball machine suddenly swings open. WAYNE SCOTT, dressed in raggedy sweats, steps into the room carrying a CAN OF BEER and a bowl of JIFFY-POP. Master Mind cannot believe his horrified eyes. MASTER MIND Ahhhhhh! Wayne Scott is just as startled. WAYNE SCOTT Jesus! He drop his drink and snack to the floor. The two men stare at each other as they struggle to regain their normal breathing patterns. Wayne Scott walks over to the couch, brushes off a thick layer of chip crumbs, and sits down. WAYNE SCOTT (CONTD) What the hell are you doing here? 95. MASTER MIND I might just ask you the same question. I had thought I incinerated you. WAYNE SCOTT You scared the bejesus out of me. Howd you figure out I was still alive? Wait, how do you know my identity!? MASTER MIND Roxanne told me. As for your ruse, I forgot to line the bottom of the copper cage - Somebody pointed that out to me recently. Figured if they could do it, so could you. But one thing I couldnt figure out - WAYNE SCOTT The skeleton? Something I borrowed from a medical school a few months before. MASTER MIND A few months? How long had you been planning this? WAYNE SCOTT I always planned to retire - eventually. I mean, come on, you cant do this sort of thing in your fifties. Youd just look ridiculous. The pieces of the puzzle appear to be coming together in Master Minds head. MASTER MIND I see it all so clearly now. INT. MASTER MINDS HYDROFOIL - FLASHBACK Master Mind and his minions cover their eyes as the observatory explodes. MASTER MIND (CONTD - V.O.) You must have done it just seconds before the observatory exploded. 96. INT. OBSERVATORY - FLASHBACK Similar to what Titan did, Uberman bores out from under the cage. MASTER MIND (CONTD - V.O.) You bore out from under the cage. Then, using your Uber-Speed, - EXT. OBSERVATORY - FLASHBACK Running in a blur-like haze, Uberman screeches to a halt in front of some bushes. MASTER MIND (CONTD - V.O.) - you made your way to safety, where you had the skeleton safely hidden away somewhere. EXT OBSERVATORY - SKY - DAY Uberman soars high above the clouds. He looks down at the observatory, which is a mere speck in the distance. MASTER MIND (CONTD - V.O) (CONTD) Then you must have flown to a safe distance and waited for the explosion, then... Just as the observatory explodes Uberman aims and throws the SKELETON like a javelin. It soars through the air like a missile, tearing through the flames of the explosion, and crashing right into the windshield of Master Minds hydrofoil. END OF FLASHBACK Wayne stares at Master Mind, clearly impressed. WAYNE Man, you ARE smart. MASTER MIND But why fake your death? Why go through all of it? You could have just quit. WAYNE SCOTT But the responsibility would still be there. (MORE) 97. WAYNE SCOTT(contd) A cop can retire and stop handing out speeding tickets - but people expect more from superheroes. I tell you, a volcano couldnt erupt in Zimbabwe without everyone expecting me to do something about it. I figured, out of sight, out of mind. MASTER MIND And Wayne Scott? Why did he have to disappear? WAYNE SCOTT Both of my lives have so much baggage. Its time for new baggage, you know? Master Minds is absolutely flabbergasted. MASTER MIND I just cant believe it. This whole time youve been in hiding while a force of great evil is tearing your city apart? Wayne rises to his feet, waving his hands for Master Mind to say no more. WAYNE SCOTT I dont want to hear about it. Thats why I dont have a television in here to remind me of all the things I SHOULD be doing. Hell, I could get a wife to do that. MASTER MIND Theres a demented supervillain out there about to destroy our - I mean, your city. Wayne shrugs indifferently. MASTER MIND Youre really going to do nothing? WAYNE SCOTT Good and evil have a way of balancing themselves out. If this guy is as bad as you say, somebody will rise up to fight him. Its just the order of things. You found me, didnt you? 98. Wayne puts a condescending hand on Master Minds shoulder. WAYNE SCOTT (CONTD) I know its hard, but youll find someone else someday. He then starts walking to the door. MASTER MIND Youre the only one who can stop him. Wayne turns around. WAYNE SCOTT Couldnt if I wanted to. Gotta a plane to catch. MASTER MIND A plane? WAYNE SCOTT Going to Barbados for a little change in climate. Now, if youll excuse me, I got to go pack. He reads the still defeated look on Master Minds face. WAYNE SCOTT (CONTD) You were a good foe. Im sorry if Ive let you down. If it makes a difference, you were the best foe a hero could ask for. MASTER MIND Not smart enough to come up with a full-proof trap. WAYNE SCOTT Well, you did almost have me when you figured out my weakness was copper. Now that made me sweat a little. Took me way too long to drill out from under that cage. MASTER MIND I got lucky. WAYNE SCOTT Anyway, its a good thing for my sake that I could always count on you for an out. 99. MASTER MIND (suddenly confused) What do you mean? WAYNE SCOTT Cmon, we always threw each other a couple of bones. You would always leave me an out in one of your full-proof traps, and Id never had you incarcerated at a penitentiary that you couldnt eventually escape from. It kept our little game going. Master Mind seems deflated. MASTER MIND Game? - Was that all this ever was to you? You know, I was trying my best every time I fought you. Those outs as you call them were unintentional. WAYNE SCOTT Oh. MASTER MIND I guess I was never really a match for you, was I? Wayne shrugs. MASTER MIND (CONTD) (thoughtfully) Then how can I expect to be one for Titan? A beaten man, Master Mind heads for the door, but stops and turns around. MASTER MIND (CONTD) What about Roxanne? Wayne unleashes an exhausted sigh. WAYNE SCOTT I think we both got what we wanted out of our relationship. She got a career out of me, and I got plenty of other things out of her. But Im ready to move on to greener pastures. 100. Master Minds steel hand clinches into a fist at his side. Waynes oblivious to this. MASTER MIND I guess I wasnt the villain I thought I was, and you...you werent the hero I thought you were. He turns to make his exit when he suddenly sees ROXANNE STANDING IN THE DOOR FRAME. Wayne is almost at a loss for words. WAYNE SCOTT Roxanne! How long have you been... ROXANNE Long enough. Roxanne looks at Master Mind. ROXANNE (CONTD) Dont you have something else you can go do? Master Mind leaves Roxanne and Wayne facing each other in silence. EXT. ANOTHER BAR - DAY Titan emerges with Brad and Frank. Hes holding a BEER CAN and a bag of PORK RINDS. TITAN Alright, I want this whole thing to look ESPN professional, understand? A distant MECHANIZED RUMBLE can be heard. The noise rises, signaling the approach of something powerful. Titan and his crew walk out to the center of the plaza as the sound becomes almost deafening. A TANK TRACK as it moves over the street. We PULL BACK to see a whole line of TANKS rolling along the street. PLAZA From the five streets branching off the plaza, a dozen tanks roll toward Titan. 101. Titan turns to Brad and Frank. TITAN (CONTD) You guys are about to get some good footage. I might need a little room, though. Brad and Frank look at each other and run to take cover behind a nearby building. Meanwhile, Titan nonchalantly sips from his beer as the tanks begin to surround them. FEEDBACK belts out of one of the tanks loudspeakers, causing Titan to do a mock wince. TANK LOUDSPEAKER Titan, we have orders from the city of Metro to take you into custody. If you do not give your self up willingly, we will be forced to open fire. Theres a long pause as no one says anything. TANK LOUDSPEAKER What is your answer? Titan takes a sip of his beverage and UNLEASHES A GIGANTIC BURP - The shockwave of which sends several of the tanks flying into a nearby building. Two of the remaining tanks close in on the villain. Both have him dead to rights at point-blank range with their massive guns. Titan sets down his beer, then calmly plugs a fist into each barrel. They FIRE. The FORCE OF THE BLAST SENDS THEM BOTH FLYING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS where they CRASH into nearby buildings. Titan bends down and pick his beet back up. TITAN (to beer) Miss me? Titan is suddenly bombarded by a massive barrage of machine- gun fire. The force sends him flying into the windshield of a nearby car. 102. He looks up to see an APACHE ASSAULT COPTER. Its nose- mounted GATLING-GUN is turning toward him. Titan gets up to his feet and looks down at his beer can. The bottom of it was blown apart in the blast. TITAN (CONTD) Didnt mean to get you involved in all of this. He stared daggers up at the helicopter pilot just as the gun gets a bead on him. TITAN (CONTD) Hey, man! You killed my suds! Titan throws the can up and slaps it with the palm of his hand. It flies with so much force it knocks the helicopter blade clean off. The rest of the Apache crashes to the street like a car dropped off a building. TITAN (CONTD) Thats one was for you, beer. Titan salutes the wreckage and walks away to find Brad and Frank still hiding behind the building. TITAN Guys, please tell me you got that last bit. BRAD HELMS Huh? TITAN Youre kidding me. I give you my sexiest moves and you mean to tell me it was for nothing? BRAD HELMS We were afraid something might hit us. TITAN Looks like Ive given the story of the century to the wrong man. He thinks about this for a moment, then it hits him. 103. TITAN Wait. What about that other reporter. Blond. Not so lumpy on the topper half, but killer legs. BRAD HELMS Roxanne. You want Roxanne. Shes a much better reporter than I am. You want her. TITAN Where can I find her. FRANK Were actually not supposed to give out that sort of information. BRAD HELMS 1314 Mockingbird Lane. I believe she lives in a penthouse. TITAN Youve been very helpful. He tosses Brad over his shoulder like a discarded ice cream cone. In the faint distance we see him splash down in the middle of the Metro City river. INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY - DAY Master Mind, pacing anxiously as Plato and Da Vinci pack boxes. Obviously Master Mind is going on the lamb. MASTER MIND Hurry, we must be on our way as soon as possible. DA VINCI Master, why must we flee? MASTER MIND I told you, Titan is too powerful. If hes set on destroying us, theres precious little we could do about it. DA VINCI Where are we going? 104. MASTER MIND To another city, someplace with a shitload of superheroes to fight. Well start over, well go back to doing what we do best. PLATO With our tails between our legs? The old Master Mind would never have let this comment slip by, but as we have seen, hes not the same man. MASTER MIND Plato, do you have a better plan?! Master Minds cell phone rings. He turns in shame from his men and answers it. MASTER MIND (CONTD) Hello...Roxanne? INT. ROXANNES APARTMENT Roxanne paces back and forth on the phone. ROXANNE What are you going to do about Tighten? INTERCUT between Master Mind and Roxanne on phone. MASTER MIND Right now Im packing, later Ill have a snack on the train. ROXANNE Youre running away? MASTER MIND In a word - yes. ROXANNE You created this monster... MASTER MIND I didnt create this - the gods of irony did and I am eating the crow I so richly deserve. ROXANNE Theres no time for self pity. 105. MASTER MIND Ill make the time. Roxanne cant believe what shes hearing. MASTER MIND (CONTD) You can leave with us. Youll be safe. ROXANNE Im not going anywhere. MASTER MIND Will you listen to me, no one can stop him. ROXANNE You have to try. The city needs your help. MASTER MIND Im afraid you have an inflated opinion of me. ROXANNE What the hells happened to you? The Master Mind I knew would never have run from a fight even though he knew deep in his heart that he didnt have a chance in hell of winning it. It was your best quality. You need to be that man right now...I... MASTER MIND What? ROXANNE (heart felt) I believe in you. Master Mind is taken aback, in a good way. But he catches himself before the words swell his heart. MASTER MIND Sweet words, but that man is dead. Please, Roxanne, just come with me. ROXANNE No...I guess you are a coward after all. Suddenly, theres a loud crash. 106. Roxanne looks up to see a huge hunk of her ceiling has been completely ripped off. Titan is flying above, holding the debris as casually as if it were a paper plate at a barbecue. He looks down at her and smiles. TITAN Man, have I got a story for you. Master Mind can hears Titans familiar laugh from his side of the line. MASTER MIND Roxanne? Roxanne? EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY Titan is standing in front of the bowling alley, trying to decide on an appropriate pose for the occasion. TITAN What pose would be best? The corny folded arms thing? He demonstrates, arching his chin proudly in the air. TITAN Or maybe on the hips, like this. Its the classic Superman pose, only not as masculine. TITAN No, makes me look like a flamer pirate. As Titan starts to fix his hair in the window, Frank pretends to fix the lens on his camera as he speaks to Roxanne. FRANK (whispering) Shouldnt we be making a run for it right about now? ROXANNE (whispering) The guy can outrun bullets. I dont think either one of us is in that kind of shape. TITAN Shes right, Frank. 107. Frank looks up, stunned that Titan could have possibly heard him. TITAN Also got super hearing. I promise not to keep the both of you long, but youll thank me when this is all over. Frank and Roxanne exchange helpless expressions. INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY - DAY Master Mind reverently stares up at the painted portrait of his father. MASTER MIND Dad, its me... (he looks around to make sure no one can hear) ...Bubsy. I know we havent talked in a while, and Im sorry. Its been a little crazy trying to live up to a legacy. The paintings menacing stare seems to reach into his very soul. MASTER MIND Anyway...You raised me to be the worst that I could possibly be. And Ive tried to live up to that as best as I could - even dropping out of dentistry school like you wanted me to. But Im about to do something now that would really piss you off. Im going to go against everything you ever taught me. I hope...I hope that maybe youll look down at what Im about to do as not so much a good deed, but more like the outright defiance of a hateful and ungrateful, son. If you could do that, then maybe - in your own little way - you could - for probably the first time - find a reason to be proud of me. He looks back up at the picture. Is it our imagination, or does the paintings stare suddenly seem even angrier? 108. MASTER MIND Well...either way, youre probably going to see me real soon. (calling over his shoulder) Men? Plato and Da Vinci suddenly stop what theyre doing and look up at him. PLATO AND DA VINCI Yes Sir? MASTER MIND Stop packing. Our work is not finished here. PLATO AND DA VINCI YES SIR! TELEVISION A news report shows an aerial shot of Titan setting the giant ball down in the middle of a vacant city street. REPORTER We interrupt your regular afternoon programming to show you live footage of a potential dangerous situation in downtown Metro. The former hero knows as Titan is placing what appears to be a giant ball... INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS Da Vinci stops in front of a television set, seeing the news report in progress. REPORTER Hold on...It appears our own Roxanne Ritchi is somehow at the scene. We now go to her with a live report. DA VINCI Sir, I think you should see this! CUT TO 109. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY Roxanne is standing in front of a camera with a mike in her hand. ROXANNE Im here with the cause of the destruction in Metro City. He has kidnapped me and a cameraman to chronicle what he refers to as the creation of a monument to his invincibility and overall Asskickiness. He will use this giant concrete bowling ball to play the largest game of bowling ever using the buildings of downtown Metro City as his pins. Titan suddenly steps into the shot. TITAN And Im going for the biggest strike ever. He leans into the camera. TITAN And you, Metro City, have a ringside seat as I cement my name in the anal of history. ROXANNE Annals. TITAN What? ROXANNE Nevermind. EXT. CITY STREET - MOMENTS LATER Titan holds up the massive bowling ball, lining up his shot. TITAN (in quiet professional bowler announcer voice) Like Tiger before him, a young savior has come to raise a sport from the ashes. Rookie Hal Stewart, a young man with a dream, realizing that dream here today, folks. (MORE) 110. TITAN(contd) One might click there heels and say Theres no place like home upon finding themselves in such a fantasy. Well, Hal looks very much at home right were he is - with a ball in hand and glory in his sights. INT. METRO CITY LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS In the bowels of Master Minds hideout, the HYDROGEN REACTOR glows and HUMS MENACINGLY. BACK TO SCENE Roxanne just stand helpless as Frank films away. ROXANNE Hal, I know everyone treated you like shit, but you dont have to do this. TITAN Youre right. I dont HAVE to do anything. Isnt that cool? Titan lines up his shot. TITAN Heres one for the record books! Titan flies a few feet and rolls the ball down the main street. ROXANNE Her face is utter horror as she watches the inevitable destruction of Metro City. As the ball rolls - it demolishes everything in its wake cars, street lamps - windows shatter as the giant concrete sphere brushes along side buildings. TITAN He smiles in anticipation and uses body English to direct the ball. GIANT BOWLING BALL POV Its nearly halfway to its target. ROXANNE 111. She closes her eyes. Titans smile fades. He looks around as if he hears something we dont. About two hundred feet in front of the first building a GIANT SPIDER WEB flies across the path of the ball, creating a defensive barrier. An enormous letter M is etched in the webs center. TITAN (CONTD) What the...? The ball breaks through the web, but its speed is greatly reduced. FRANK Look, whats that flying in the air? We suddenly see MASTER MIND FLYING OVER THE ROLLING BALL IN A JET PACK. He quickly pulls out his goo gun and starts laying down a path of sticky plasm to stop the destructive spheres path. MASTER MIND Cmon, slow down Master Mind looks down to see the meter of the gun close to empty. MASTER MIND Cmon. The ball slows drastically then starts rolling to the side. It heads off an embankment and rolls harmlessly into a CANAL. MASTER MIND Gutterball! TITAN Hes furious to say the least. TITAN YOU! Master Mind gives him a mocking grin. MASTER MIND Bowling? What other trailer park sports can you play? 112. TITAN You are becoming a real pain in my ass. I should have done this a long time ago. Titan lunges at his tormentor. Master Mind hits the BOOSTER on his jet pack and heads back toward the other side of the city with Titan in hot pursuit. MASTER MIND (CONTD) (into walkie talkie) Plato, Da Vinci. Secure Roxanne, hes falling for it. ELSEWHERE A flustered Titan lands. He begins searching the city streets, but Master Mind is nowhere in sight. He turns upon hearing an EEKING sound to his left. Sitting on the ground is a CHIMPANZEE wearing a strange collar. It smiles at him. TITAN What the hell? From behind, Titan is immediately set upon by five more RADIO CONTROLLED APES. TITAN (CONTD) GODAMNIT! The critters bite hop and hit Titan. As soon as he throws one off two more jump him. Titan breaks free and with his mighty breath blows them across the street into a fruit stand. With Titan out of their sight they begin to attack the fruit. MASTER MIND Hes a block away frantically hitting his remote. MASTER MIND Shit! Stupid monkeys and their fruit. Titan flies away from the mad monkeys and lands to find Master Mind sitting on the ground wrapped in a long cape with only his head sticking out. 113. TITAN (CONTD) No more games. Titan FIRES HIS LASER VISION AT MASTER MINDs CHEST. Master Mind pulls the cloak away to reveal a FIRE HYDRANT. Titans EYE LASERS burn through the hydrant releasing a high pressure stream of water. Master Mind uses the last remote which dumps two tons of CEMENT mix into the truck. The crowd, police and news crews move in closer when Titan doesnt emerge. Master Mind drops his last remote and walks toward the truck cautiously. MASTER MIND Could it really be that easy-- - BOOM - The back of the truck explodes, throwing dust and concrete everywhere. When the dust clears we see and enraged Titan. MASTER MIND (CONTD) Didnt think so. As the villain walks toward him, he pulls back his fist to give Master Mind the killing blow. TITAN If you dont mind, Im going to punch trough your face now. Preparing himself for the end, Master Mind shuts his eyes as a SUDDEN GUST OF WIND BEGINS TO PICK UP. AS Titan goes to strike, a BLURRY FIGURE RUNS IN AND SNATCHES MASTER MIND OUT OF THE AWAY. Stunned, Master Mind begins to feel around his body as if to make sure everythings still in place. MASTER MIND Im alive. He turns to see UBERMAN standing next to him. MASTER MIND Uberman? 114. The terrified bystanders start to notice the figure standing next to Master Mind. BYSTANDER 1 Its Uberman! BYSTANDER 2 Ubermans alive! BYSTANDER 3 Were saved! As the CROWD CHEERS, A confused Master Mind turns to Metro Citys newly resurrected champion. MASTER MIND I thought. UBERMAN So did I. He puts a hand on Master Minds shoulder. UBERMAN Thank you, old enemy. MASTER MIND For what? UBERMAN Showing me the error of my ways, Showing me Im meant to be this citys savior, showing me that, while we can try, there is no running away from our true destiny. With that, UBERMAN IS STRICKEN BY A LASER BLAST, INSTANTLY TURNING HIM INTO A CHARRED HUMAN SKELETON. Master Mind turns to see Titan smiling with his STILL SMOKING EYES. TITAN Oh...Did I interrupt something? Master Mind turns to run, but, suddenly Titan is before him. TITAN Where you going, buddy? Titan grabs Master Mind by the collar and throws him across the street into a parked car. 115. TITAN (CONTD) Welcome to Paintown. Population you. Master Mind manages to stand on shaky legs. He seems in a daze, unable to move. Titan flies up in the air. TITAN (CONTD) Time to finish this. With his fist front and center, Titan speeds toward Master Mind. Hes like a human torpedo, coming in for the killing blow. Master Mind comes to his senses and puts up his hands. MASTER MIND WAIT!!! Titan screeches to a halt and stops just in front of him like an old Warner Bros cartoon. TITAN What? MASTER MIND Quick joke - Whats the capital of Thailand? TITAN Huh - I dont know. MASTER MIND Its bang cock! In a sudden surge of strength, MASTER MIND PUNCHES TITAN IN THE GROIN. The once mighty man instantly drops to his knees, searching, with tears in his eyes, for the proper word to express the pain suddenly surging through his member. TITAN (CONTD) Ow. Baffled, he looks up at Master Minds hand and sees his gauntlet is now made ENTIRELY OUT OF COPPER. MASTER MIND So, I guess pennies are good for something. 116. He punches Titan in the face, knocking him out cold. Master Mind looks down on Titan with more than a little pride. Suddenly he hears something behind him. He spins to see the crowd making a strange noise - APPLAUSE. Roxanne comes up to him. The crowd starts to go wild and cheers for Master Mind. Hes not sure what to make of it. ROXANNE Pretty strange, huh? MASTER MIND Theyre cheering for me. ROXANNE You saved them. You saved everybody. Hows it feel? Master Mind looks at the smiles all around him. He begins to well up a little. MASTER MIND Its a...its nice, you know? I usually dont get a lot of feedback. (whispering) But I also kind of caused all this. What happens when they find that out I was the cause of some of this? Roxanne looks at the cheering crowd, then back at Master Mind. ROXANNE What they dont know wont hurt them. MASTER MIND I guess that is all in the past. ROXANNE Youre the hero. MASTER MIND I dont think Id go that far...I mean I just...er... ROXANNE Master Mind? 117. MASTER MIND Yes? ROXANNE Stop talking. She kisses him. The crowd erupts in a cheer. TELEVISION The channel 7 he channel 7 logo zooms in followed by the title Eye on Metro City. A picture of Master Mind smiling appears on the screen behind her. SAMANTHA SUMMERS Whos bad? Well, not Master Mind. It seems the former villain has done a career 180 after defeating Tighten and saving Metro City from certain enslavement. And here he is getting a full pardon by Metro Citys Mayor, Steve Dent. Cut to ceremony on capital steps. The MAYOR is shaking Master Minds metal gauntlet when it suddenly STARTS TO CRUSH HIS HAND. MAYOR Ahhh! Secret service men quickly start to draw their weapons and take aim at Master Mind. Realizing whats happening, he quickly lets the mayors hand go and puts his arms in the air. MASTER MIND Sorry - Metal hand. Force of habit. He elbows the mayor. MASTER MIND (CONTD) Were okay, right? Wincing, the mayor signals the men to put their guns down. WE CUT to video of Titan behind bars in a regular prison. 118. BRAD HELMS And what about Tighten? Is there a prison in existence that can hold this super powered menace? Well, the answer we found is no. A man in a white lab coat stands in front of Titans cell just out of reach. PRISON SCIENTIST Of course normally he could break out of there anytime, but as you can see weve taken some special precautions. The news camera pans over see Titan in his cell wearing a copper JOCK STRAP with electrical cables hooked to it. Back to Samantha at the desk. BRAD HELMS What is a Hero? It seems never has that question needed to be asked more than it does tonight. We go to our very own Roxanne Ritchi, making her triumphant return to our news desk for the answer. Brad turns. The camera pans over to Roxanne who we now see has been sitting beside him. ROXANNE What is a hero? Well, there are many different kinds. There are those who hear a call, like the policeman or doctor, then theres the kind the public creates in their search for meaning and hope. Then, there are those who have the courage to change. DARK ALLEY - NIGHT A woman is being chased by two large thugs. Theyre gaining on her. She comes to a brick wall - a dead end. The thugs laugh. THUG 1 Hey, gimme that purse? 119. MASTER MIND (O.S) I dont think it would go with your outfit. The thugs turn around to see Master Mind, standing with his arms folded across his chest. THUG 2 Its Master Mind! Thug 1 draws a knife. THUG 1 So? Its not like he has any superpowers. Thug 1 puts his fingers to his mouth and whistles. Suddenly two more Thugs appear behind Master Mind. MASTER MIND Im gonna give you a chance to surrender. THUG 1 Four against one. For a Master Mind, youre really bad at math. Master Mind throws a hand signal up in the air. Suddenly a giant robotic foot crashes down on the two men behind him. Thug 1 and Thug 2 drop their knives and raise their hands in the air. Master Mind looks up and waves. MASTER MIND Way to take out those two goons, guys! We see Da Vinci and Plato at the wheel of a gigantic robot. DA VINCI What two goons? The giant robot lifts its foot to check the bottom of its sole. It KNOCKS OVER WATER TOWER in the process. The woman looks at Master Mind, horrified. 120. MASTER MIND (apologetically) Sorry, were new at this. THE END",repository,

Online User Forum For technical questions regarding the Control System or the FTC SDK, please visit the FTC Technology forum FTC Technology Forum Release Information Version 5.5 (20200824-090813) Version 5.5 requires Android Studio 4.0 or later. New features Adds support for calling custom Java classes from Blocks OpModes (fixes SkyStone issue 161). Classes must be in the org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode package. Methods must be public static and have no more than 21 parameters. Parameters declared as OpMode, LinearOpMode, Telemetry, and HardwareMap are supported and the argument is provided automatically, regardless of the order of the parameters. On the block, the sockets for those parameters are automatically filled in. Parameters declared as char or java.lang.Character will accept any block that returns text and will only use the first character in the text. Parameters declared as boolean or java.lang.Boolean will accept any block that returns boolean. Parameters declared as byte, java.lang.Byte, short, java.lang.Short, int, java.lang.Integer, long, or java.lang.Long, will accept any block that returns a number and will round that value to the nearest whole number. Parameters declared as float, java.lang.Float, double, java.lang.Double will accept any block that returns a number. Adds telemetry API method for setting display format Classic Monospace HTML (certain tags only) Adds blocks support for switching cameras. Adds Blocks support for TensorFlow Object Detection with a custom model. Adds support for uploading a custom TensorFlow Object Detection model in the Manage page, which is especially useful for Blocks and OnBotJava users. Shows new Control Hub blink codes when the WiFi band is switched using the Control Hubs button (only possible on Control Hub OS 1.1.2) Adds new warnings which can be disabled in the Advanced RC Settings Mismatched app versions warning Unnecessary 2.4 GHz WiFi usage warning REV Hub is running outdated firmware (older than version 1.8.2) Adds support for Sony PS4 gamepad, and reworks how gamepads work on the Driver Station Removes preference which sets gamepad type based on driver position. Replaced with menu which allows specifying type for gamepads with unknown VID and PID Attempts to auto-detect gamepad type based on USB VID and PID If gamepad VID and PID is not known, use type specified by user for that VID and PID If gamepad VID and PID is not known AND the user has not specified a type for that VID and PID, an educated guess is made about how to map the gamepad Driver Station will now attempt to automatically recover from a gamepad disconnecting, and re-assign it to the position it was assigned to when it dropped If only one gamepad is assigned and it drops it can be recovered If two gamepads are assigned, and have different VID/PID signatures, and only one drops it will be recovered If two gamepads are assigned, and have different VID/PID signatures, and BOTH drop both will be recovered If two gamepads are assigned, and have the same VID/PID signatures, and only one drops it will be recovered If two gamepads are assigned, and have the same VID/PID signatures, and BOTH drop neither will be recovered, because of the ambiguity of the gamepads when they re-appear on the USB bus. There is currently one known edge case if there are two gamepads with the same VID/PID signature plugged in, but only one is assigned, and they BOTH drop, its a 50-50 chance of which one will be chosen for automatic recovery to the assigned position it is determined by whichever one is re-enumerated first by the USB bus controller. Adds landscape user interface to Driver Station New feature practice timer with audio cues New feature (Control Hub only) wireless network connection strength indicator (0-5 bars) New feature (Control Hub only) tapping on the ping/channel display will switch to an alternate display showing radio RX dBm and link speed (tap again to switch back) The layout will NOT autorotate. You can switch the layout from the Driver Stations settings menu. Breaking changes Removes support for Android versions 4.4 through 5.1 (KitKat and Lollipop). The minSdkVersion is now 23. Removes the deprecated LinearOpMode methods waitOneFullHardwareCycle() and waitForNextHardwareCycle() Enhancements Handles RS485 address of Control Hub automatically The Control Hub is automatically given a reserved address Existing configuration files will continue to work All addresses in the range of 1-10 are still available for Expansion Hubs The Control Hub light will now normally be solid green, without blinking to indicate the address The Control Hub will not be shown on the Expansion Hub Address Change settings page Improves REV Hub firmware updater The user can now choose between all available firmware update files Version 1.8.2 of the REV Hub firmware is bundled into the Robot Controller app. Text was added to clarify that Expansion Hubs can only be updated via USB. Firmware update speed was reduced to improve reliability Allows REV Hub firmware to be updated directly from the Manage webpage Improves log viewer on Robot Controller Horizontal scrolling support (no longer word wrapped) Supports pinch-to-zoom Uses a monospaced font Error messages are highlighted New color scheme Attempts to force-stop a runaway/stuck OpMode without restarting the entire app Not all types of runaway conditions are stoppable, but if the user code attempts to talk to hardware during the runaway, the system should be able to capture it. Makes various tweaks to the Self Inspect screen Renames OS version entry to Android version Renames WiFi Direct Name to WiFi Name Adds Control Hub OS version, when viewing the report of a Control Hub Hides the airplane mode entry, when viewing the report of a Control Hub Removes check for ZTE Speed Channel Changer Shows firmware version for all Expansion and Control Hubs Reworks network settings portion of Manage page All network settings are now applied with a single click The WiFi Direct channel of phone-based Robot Controllers can now be changed from the Manage page WiFi channels are filtered by band (2.4 vs 5 GHz) and whether they overlap with other channels The current WiFi channel is pre-selected on phone-based Robot Controllers, and Control Hubs running OS 1.1.2 or later. On Control Hubs running OS 1.1.2 or later, you can choose to have the system automatically select a channel on the 5 GHz band Improves OnBotJava New light and dark themes replace the old themes (chaos, github, chrome,...) the new default theme is light and will be used when you first update to this version OnBotJava now has a tabbed editor Read-only offline mode Improves function of exit menu item on Robot Controller and Driver Station Now guaranteed to be fully stopped and unloaded from memory Shows a warning message if a LinearOpMode exists prematurely due to failure to monitor for the start condition Improves error message shown when the Driver Station and Robot Controller are incompatible with each other Driver Station OpMode Control Panel now disabled while a Restart Robot is in progress Disables advanced settings related to WiFi direct when the Robot Controller is a Control Hub. Tint phone battery icons on Driver Station when low/critical. Uses names Control Hub Portal and Control Hub (when appropriate) in new configuration files Improve I2C read performance Very large improvement on Control Hub up to 2x faster with small (e.g. 6 byte) reads Not as apparent on Expansion Hubs connected to a phone Update/refresh build infrastructure Update to androidx support library from com.android.supportappcompat, which is end-of-life Update targetSdkVersion and compileSdkVersion to 28 Update Android Studios Android plugin to latest Fix reported build timestamp in About screen Add sample illustrating manual webcam use ConceptWebcam Bug fixes Fixes SkyStone issue 248 Fixes SkyStone issue 232 and modifies bulk caching semantics to allow for cache-preserving MANUAL/AUTO transitions. Improves performance when REV 2M distance sensor is unplugged Improves readability of Toast messages on certain devices Allows a Driver Station to connect to a Robot Controller after another has disconnected Improves generation of fake serial numbers for UVC cameras which do not provide a real serial number Previously some devices would assign such cameras a serial of 00 and fail to open and start streaming Fixes ftc_app issue 638. Fixes a slew of bugs with the Vuforia camera monitor including Fixes bug where preview could be displayed with a wonky aspect ratio Fixes bug where preview could be cut off in landscape Fixes bug where preview got totally messed up when rotating phone Fixes bug where crosshair could drift off target when using webcams Fixes issue in UVC driver on some devices (ftc_app 681) if streaming was started/stopped multiple times in a row Issue manifested as kernel panic on devices which do not have this kernel patch. On affected devices which do have the patch, the issue was manifest as simply a failure to start streaming. The Tech Team believes that the root cause of the issue is a bug in the Linux kernel XHCI driver. A workaround was implemented in the SDK UVC driver. Fixes bug in UVC driver where often half the frames from the camera would be dropped (e.g. only 15FPS delivered during a streaming session configured for 30FPS). Fixes issue where TensorFlow Object Detection would show results whose confidence was lower than the minimum confidence parameter. Fixes a potential exploitation issue of CVE-2019-11358 in OnBotJava Fixes changing the address of an Expansion Hub with additional Expansion Hubs connected to it Preserves the Control Hubs network connection when Restart Robot is selected Fixes issue where device scans would fail while the Robot was restarting Fix RenderScript usage Use androidx.renderscript variant increased compatibility Use RenderScript in Java mode, not native simplifies build Fixes webcam-frame-to-bitmap conversion problem alpha channel wasnt being initialized, only R, G,  B Fixes possible arithmetic overflow in Deadline Fixes deadlock in Vuforia webcam support which could cause 5-second delays when stopping OpMode Version 5.4 (20200108-101156) Fixes SkyStone issue 88 Adds an inspection item that notes when a robot controller (Control Hub) is using the factory default password. Fixes SkyStone issue 61 Fixes SkyStone issue 142 Fixes ftc_app issue 417 by adding more current and voltage monitoring capabilities for REV Hubs. Fixes a crash sometimes caused by OnBotJava activity Improves OnBotJava autosave functionality ftc_app 738 Fixes system responsiveness issue when an Expansion Hub is disconnected Fixes issue where IMU initialization could prevent Op Modes from stopping Fixes issue where AndroidTextToSpeech.speak() would fail if it was called too early Adds telemetry.speak() methods and blocks, which cause the Driver Station (if also updated) to speak text Adds and improves Expansion Hub-related warnings Improves Expansion Hub low battery warning Displays the warning immediately after the hub reports it Specifies whether the condition is current or occurred temporarily during an OpMode run Displays which hubs reported low battery Displays warning when hub loses and regains power during an OpMode run Fixes the hubs LED pattern after this condition Displays warning when Expansion Hub is not responding to commands Specifies whether the condition is current or occurred temporarily during an OpMode run Clarifies warning when Expansion Hub is not present at startup Specifies that this condition requires a Robot Restart before the hub can be used. The hub light will now accurately reflect this state Improves logging and reduces log spam during these conditions Syncs the Control Hub time and timezone to a connected web browser programming the robot, if a Driver Station is not available. Adds bulk read functionality for REV Hubs A bulk caching mode must be set at the Hub level with LynxModulesetBulkCachingMode(). This applies to all relevant SDK hardware classes that reference that Hub. The following following Hub bulk caching modes are available BulkCachingMode.OFF (default) All hardware calls operate as usual. Bulk data can read through LynxModulegetBulkData() and processed manually. BulkCachingMode.AUTO Applicable hardware calls are served from a bulk read cache that is cleared/refreshed automatically to ensure identical commands dont hit the same cache. The cache can also be cleared manually with LynxModuleclearBulkCache(), although this is not recommended. (advanced users) BulkCachingMode.MANUAL Same as BulkCachingMode.AUTO except the cache is never cleared automatically. To avoid getting stale data, the cache must be manually cleared at the beginning of each loop body or as the user deems appropriate. Removes PIDF Annotation values added in Rev 5.3 (to AndyMark, goBILDA and TETRIX motor configurations). The new motor types will still be available but their Default control behavior will revert back to Rev 5.2 Adds new ConceptMotorBulkRead sample Opmode to demonstrate and compare Motor Bulk-Read modes for reducing I/O latencies. Version 5.3 (20191004-112306) Fixes external USB/UVC webcam support Makes various bugfixes and improvements to Blocks page, including but not limited to Many visual tweaks Browser zoom and window resize behave better Resizing the Java preview pane works better and more consistently across browsers The Java preview pane consistently gets scrollbars when needed The Java preview pane is hidden by default on phones Internet Explorer 11 should work Large dropdown lists display properly on lower res screens Disabled buttons are now visually identifiable as disabled A warning is shown if a user selects a TFOD sample, but their device is not compatible Warning messages in a Blocks op mode are now visible by default. Adds goBILDA 5201 and 5202 motors to Robot Configurator Adds PIDF Annotation values to AndyMark, goBILDA and TETRIX motor configurations. This has the effect of causing the RUN_USING_ENCODERS and RUN_TO_POSITION modes to use PIDF vs PID closed loop control on these motors. This should provide more responsive, yet stable, speed control. PIDF adds Feedforward control to the basic PID control loop. Feedforward is useful when controlling a motors speed because it anticipates how much the control voltage must change to achieve a new speed set-point, rather than requiring the integrated error to change sufficiently. The PIDF values were chosen to provide responsive, yet stable, speed control on a lightly loaded motor. The more heavily a motor is loaded (drag or friction), the more noticable the PIDF improvement will be. Fixes startup crash on Android 10 Fixes ftc_app issue 712 (thanks to FROGbots-4634) Fixes ftc_app issue 542 Allows A and lowercase letters when naming device through RC and DS apps. Version 5.2 (20190905-083277) Fixes extra-wide margins on settings activities, and placement of the new configuration button Adds Skystone Vuforia image target data. Includes sample Skystone Vuforia Navigation op modes (Java). Includes sample Skystone Vuforia Navigation op modes (Blocks). Adds TensorFlow inference model (.tflite) for Skystone game elements. Includes sample Skystone TensorFlow op modes (Java). Includes sample Skystone TensorFlow op modes (Blocks). Removes older (season-specific) sample op modes. Includes 64-bit support (to comply with Google Play requirements). Protects against Stuck OpModes when a Restart Robot is requested. (Thanks to FROGbots-4634) (ftc_app issue 709) Blocks related changes Fixes bug with blocks generated code when hardware device name is a java or javascript reserved word. Shows generated java code for blocks, even when hardware items are missing from the active configuration. Displays warning icon when outdated Vuforia and TensorFlow blocks are used (SkyStone issue 27) Version 5.1 (20190820-222104) Defines default PIDF parameters for the following motors REV Core Hex Motor REV 201 HD Hex Motor REV 401 HD Hex Motor Adds back button when running on a device without a system back button (such as a Control Hub) Allows a REV Control Hub to update the firmware on a REV Expansion Hub via USB Fixes SkyStone issue 9 Fixes ftc_app issue 715 Prevents extra DS User clicks by filtering based on current state. Prevents incorrect DS UI state changes when receiving new OpMode list from RC Adds support for REV Color Sensor V3 Adds a manual-refresh DS Camera Stream for remotely viewing RC camera frames. To show the stream on the DS, initialize but do not run a stream-enabled opmode, select the Camera Stream option in the DS menu, and tap the image to refresh. This feature is automatically enabled when using Vuforia or TFODno additional RC configuration is required for typical use cases. To hide the stream, select the same menu item again. Note that gamepads are disabled and the selected opmode cannot be started while the stream is open as a safety precaution. To use custom streams, consult the API docs for CameraStreamServersetSource and CameraStreamSource. Adds many Star Wars sounds to RobotController resources. Added SKYSTONE Sounds Chooser Sample Program. Switches out startup, connect chimes, and error/warning sounds for Star Wars sounds Updates OnBot Java to use a WebSocket for communication with the robot The OnBot Java page no longer has to do a full refresh when a user switches from editing one file to another Known issues Camera Stream The Vuforia camera stream inherits the issues present in the phone preview (namely ftc_app issue 574). This problem does not affect the TFOD camera stream even though it receives frames from Vuforia. The orientation of the stream frames may not always match the phone preview. For now, these frames may be rotated manually via a custom CameraStreamSource if desired. OnBotJava Browser back button may not always work correctly Its possible for a build to be queued, but not started. The OnBot Java build console will display a warning if this occurs. A user might not realize they are editing a different file if the user inadvertently switches from one file to another since this switch is now seamless. The name of the currently open file is displayed in the browser tab. Version 5.0 (built on 19.06.14) Support for the REV Robotics Control Hub. Adds a Java preview pane to the Blocks editor. Adds a new offline export feature to the Blocks editor. Display wifi channel in Network circle on Driver Station. Adds calibration for Logitech C270 Updates build tooling and target SDK. Compliance with Googles permissions infrastructure (Required after build tooling update). Keep Alives to mitigate the Motorola wifi scanning problem. Telemetry substitute no longer necessary. Improves Vuforia error reporting. Fixes ftctechnh/ftc_app issues 621, 713. Miscellaneous bug fixes and improvements. Version 4.3 (built on 18.10.31) Includes missing TensorFlow-related libraries and files. Version 4.2 (built on 18.10.30) Includes fix to avoid deadlock situation with WatchdogMonitor which could result in USB communication errors. Comm error appeared to require that user disconnect USB cable and restart the Robot Controller app to recover. robotControllerLog.txt would have error messages that included the words E RobotCore lynx xmit lock  abandoning lock Includes fix to correctly list the parent module address for a REV Robotics Expansion Hub in a configuration (.xml) file. Bug in versions 4.0 and 4.1 would incorrect list the address module for a parent REV Robotics device as 1. If the parent module had a higher address value than the daisy-chained module, then this bug would prevent the Robot Controller from communicating with the downstream Expansion Hub. Added requirement for ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION to allow a Driver Station running Android Oreo to scan for Wi-Fi Direct devices. Added google() repo to build.gradle because aapt2 must be downloaded from the google() repository beginning with version 3.2 of the Android Gradle Plugin. Important Note Android Studio users will need to be connected to the Internet the first time build the ftc_app project. Internet connectivity is required for the first build so the appropriate files can be downloaded from the Google repository. Users should not need to be connected to the Internet for subsequent builds. This should also fix buid issue where Android Studio would complain that it Could not find com.android.tools.lintlint-gradle26.1.4 (or similar). Added support for REV Spark Mini motor controller as part of the configuration menu for a servo/PWM port on the REV Expansion Hub. Provide examples for playing audio files in an Op Mode. Block Development Tool Changes Includes a fix for a problem with the Velocity blocks that were reported in the FTC Technology forum (Blocks Programming subforum). Change the Save completed successfully. message to a white color so it will contrast with a green background. Fixed the Download image feature so it will work if there are text blocks in the op mode. Introduce support for Googles TensorFlow Lite technology for object detetion for 2018-2019 game. TensorFlow lite can recognize Gold Mineral and Silver Mineral from 2018-2019 game. Example Java and Block op modes are included to show how to determine the relative position of the gold block (left, center, right). Version 4.1 (released on 18.09.24) Changes include Fix to prevent crash when deprecated configuration annotations are used. Change to allow FTC Robot Controller APK to be auto-updated using FIRST Global Control Hub update scripts. Removed samples for non supported / non legal hardware. Improvements to Telemetry.addData block with text socket. Updated Blocks sample op mode list to include Rover Ruckus Vuforia example. Update SDK library version number. Version 4.0 (released on 18.09.12) Changes include Initial support for UVC compatible cameras If UVC camera has a unique serial number, RC will detect and enumerate by serial number. If UVC camera lacks a unique serial number, RC will only support one camera of that type connected. Calibration settings for a few cameras are included (see TeamCode/src/main/res/xml/teamwebcamcalibrations.xml for details). User can upload calibration files from Program and Manage web interface. UVC cameras seem to draw a fair amount of electrical current from the USB bus. This does not appear to present any problems for the REV Robotics Control Hub. This does seem to create stability problems when using some cameras with an Android phone-based Robot Controller. FTC Tech Team is investigating options to mitigate this issue with the phone-based Robot Controllers. Updated sample Vuforia Navigation and VuMark Op Modes to demonstrate how to use an internal phone-based camera and an external UVC webcam. Support for improved motor control. REV Robotics Expansion Hub firmware 1.8 and greater will support a feed forward mechanism for closed loop motor control. FTC SDK has been modified to support PIDF coefficients (proportional, integral, derivative, and feed forward). FTC Blocks development tool modified to include PIDF programming blocks. Deprecated older PID-related methods and variables. REVs 1.8.x PIDF-related changes provide a more linear and accurate way to control a motor. Wireless Added 5GHz support for wireless channel changing for those devices that support it. Tested with Moto G5 and E4 phones. Also tested with other (currently non-approved) phones such as Samsung Galaxy S8. Improved Expansion Hub firmware update support in Robot Controller app Changes to make the system more robust during the firmware update process (when performed through Robot Controller app). User no longer has to disconnect a downstream daisy-chained Expansion Hub when updating an Expansion Hubs firmware. If user is updating an Expansion Hubs firmware through a USB connection, he/she does not have to disconnect RS485 connection to other Expansion Hubs. The user still must use a USB connection to update an Expansion Hubs firmware. The user cannot update the Expansion Hub firmware for a downstream device that is daisy chained through an RS485 connection. If an Expansion Hub accidentally gets bricked the Robot Controller app is now more likely to recognize the Hub when it scans the USB bus. Robot Controller app should be able to detect an Expansion Hub, even if it accidentally was bricked in a previous update attempt. Robot Controller app should be able to install the firmware onto the Hub, even if if accidentally was bricked in a previous update attempt. Resiliency FTC software can detect and enable an FTDI reset feature that is available with REV Robotics v1.8 Expansion Hub firmware and greater. When enabled, the Expansion Hub can detect if it hasnt communicated with the Robot Controller over the FTDI (USB) connection. If the Hub hasnt heard from the Robot Controller in a while, it will reset the FTDI connection. This action helps system recover from some ESD-induced disruptions. Various fixes to improve reliability of FTC software. Blocks Fixed errors with string and list indices in blocks export to java. Support for USB connected UVC webcams. Refactored optimized Blocks Vuforia code to support Rover Ruckus image targets. Added programming blocks to support PIDF (proportional, integral, derivative and feed forward) motor control. Added formatting options (under Telemetry and Miscellaneous categories) so user can set how many decimal places to display a numerical value. Support to play audio files (which are uploaded through Blocks web interface) on Driver Station in addition to the Robot Controller. Fixed bug with Download Image of Blocks feature. Support for REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller. Support for REV Robotics 2m Distance Sensor. Added support for a REV Touch Sensor (no longer have to configure as a generic digital device). Added blocks for DcMotorEx methods. These are enhanced methods that you can use when supported by the motor controller hardware. The REV Robotics Expansion Hub supports these enhanced methods. Enhanced methods include methods to get/set motor velocity (in encoder pulses per second), get/set PIDF coefficients, etc.. Modest Improvements in Logging Decrease frequency of battery checker voltage statements. Removed non-FTC related log statements (wherever possible). Introduced a Match Logging feature. Under Settings a user can enable/disable this feature (its disabled by default). If enabled, user provides a Match Number through the Driver Station user interface (top of the screen). The Match Number is used to create a log file specifically with log statements from that particular Op Mode run. Match log files are stored in /sdcard/FIRST/matlogs on the Robot Controller. Once an op mode run is complete, the Match Number is cleared. This is a convenient way to create a separate match log with statements only related to a specific op mode run. New Devices Support for REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller. Support for REV Robotics 2m Distance Sensor. Added configuration option for REV 201 HD Hex Motor. Added support for a REV Touch Sensor (no longer have to configure as a generic digital device). Miscellaneous Fixed some errors in the definitions for acceleration and velocity in our javadoc documentation. Added ability to play audio files on Driver Station When user is configuring an Expansion Hub, the LED on the Expansion Hub will change blink pattern (purple-cyan) to indicate which Hub is currently being configured. Renamed I2cSensorType to I2cDeviceType. Added an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates localization using 2018-2019 (Rover Ruckus presented by QualComm) Vuforia targets. Added an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates how to use the REV Robotics 2m Laser Distance Sensor. Added an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates how to use the REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller. Re-categorized external Java sample Op Modes to TeleOp instead of Autonomous. Known issues Initial support for UVC compatible cameras UVC cameras seem to draw significant amount of current from the USB bus. This does not appear to present any problems for the REV Robotics Control Hub. This does seem to create stability problems when using some cameras with an Android phone-based Robot Controller. FTC Tech Team is investigating options to mitigate this issue with the phone-based Robot Controllers. There might be a possible deadlock which causes the RC to become unresponsive when using a UVC webcam with a Nougat Android Robot Controller. Wireless When user selects a wireless channel, this channel does not necessarily persist if the phone is power cycled. Tech Team is hoping to eventually address this issue in a future release. Issue has been present since apps were introduced (i.e., it is not new with the v4.0 release). Wireless channel is not currently displayed for WiFi Direct connections. Miscellaneous The blink indication feature that shows which Expansion Hub is currently being configured does not work for a newly created configuration file. User has to first save a newly created configuration file and then close and re-edit the file in order for blink indicator to work. Version 3.6 (built on 17.12.18) Changes include Blocks Changes Uses updated Google Blockly software to allow users to edit their op modes on Apple iOS devices (including iPad and iPhone). Improvement in Blocks tool to handle corrupt op mode files. Autonomous op modes should no longer get switched back to tele-op after re-opening them to be edited. The system can now detect type mismatches during runtime and alert the user with a message on the Driver Station. Updated javadoc documentation for setPower() method to reflect correct range of values (-1 to 1). Modified VuforiaLocalizerImpl to allow for user rendering of frames Added a user-overrideable onRenderFrame() method which gets called by the classs renderFrame() method. Version 3.5 (built on 17.10.30) Changes with version 3.5 include Introduced a fix to prevent random op mode stops, which can occur after the Robot Controller app has been paused and then resumed (for example, when a user temporarily turns off the display of the Robot Controller phone, and then turns the screen back on). Introduced a fix to prevent random op mode stops, which were previously caused by random peer disconnect events on the Driver Station. Fixes issue where log files would be closed on pause of the RC or DS, but not re-opened upon resume. Fixes issue with battery handler (voltage) start/stop race. Fixes issue where Android Studio generated op modes would disappear from available list in certain situations. Fixes problem where OnBot Java would not build on REV Robotics Control Hub.

Removed unneeded resources from android.jar binaries used by OnBot Java to reduce final size of Robot Controller app. Added MR_ANALOG_TOUCH_SENSOR block to Blocks Programming Tool. Version 3.4 (built on 17.09.06) Changes with version 3.4 include Added telemetry.update() statement for BlankLinearOpMode template. Renamed sample Block op modes to be more consistent with Java samples. Added some additional sample Block op modes. Reworded OnBot Java readme slightly. Version 3.3 (built on 17.09.04) This version of the software includes improves for the FTC Blocks Programming Tool and the OnBot Java Programming Tool. Changes with verion 3.3 include Android Studio ftc_app project has been updated to use Gradle Plugin 2.3.3. Android Studio ftc_app project is already using gradle 3.5 distribution. Robot Controller log has been renamed to /sdcard/RobotControllerLog.txt (note that this change was actually introduced w/ v3.2). Improvements in I2C reliability. Optimized I2C read for REV Expansion Hub, with v1.7 firmware or greater. Updated all external/samples (available through OnBot and in Android project folder). Vuforia Added support for VuMarks that will be used for the 2017-2018 season game. Blocks Update to latest Google Blockly release. Sample op modes can be selected as a template when creating new op mode. Fixed bug where the blocks would disappear temporarily when mouse button is held down.

Fixes and changes to complete hardware setup feature. Updated (and more useful) onBot welcome message. Known issues Android Studio After updating to the new v3.3 Android Studio project folder, if you get error messages indicating InvalidVirtualFileAccessException then you might need to do a File-Invalidate Caches / Restart to clear the error. OnBot Java Sometimes when you push the build button to build all op modes, the RC returns an error message that the build failed. If you press the build button a second time, the build typically suceeds. Version 3.2 (built on 17.08.02) This version of the software introduces the OnBot Java Development Tool. Similar to the FTC Blocks Development Tool, the FTC OnBot Java Development Tool allows a user to create, edit and build op modes dynamically using only a Javascript-enabled web browser. The OnBot Java Development Tool is an integrated development environment (IDE) that is served up by the Robot Controller. Op modes are created and edited using a Javascript-enabled browser (Google Chromse is recommended). Op modes are saved on the Robot Controller Android device directly. The OnBot Java Development Tool provides a Java programming environment that does NOT need Android Studio. Changes with version 3.2 include Enhanced web-based development tools Introduction of OnBot Java Development Tool. Web-based programming and management features are always on (user no longer needs to put Robot Controller into programming mode). Web-based management interface (where user can change Robot Controller name and also easily download Robot Controller log file). OnBot Java, Blocks and Management features available from web based interface. Blocks Programming Development Tool Changed LynxI2cColorRangeSensor block to REV Color/range sensor block. Fixed tooltip for ColorSensor.isLightOn block. Added blocks for ColorSensor.getNormalizedColors and LynxI2cColorRangeSensor.getNormalizedColors. Added example op modes for digital touch sensor and REV Robotics Color Distance sensor. User selectable color themes. Includes many minor enhancements and fixes (too numerous to list). Known issues Auto complete function is incomplete and does not support the following (for now) Access via this keyword Access via super keyword Members of the super cloass, not overridden by the class Any methods provided in the current class Inner classes Cant handle casted objects Any objects coming from an parenthetically enclosed expression Version 3.10 (built on 17.05.09) This version of the software provides support for the REV Robotics Expansion Hub. This version also includes improvements in the USB communication layer in an effort to enhance system resiliency. If you were using a 2.x version of the software previously, updating to version 3.1 requires that you also update your Driver Station software in addition to updating the Robot Controller software. Also note that in version 3.10 software, the setMaxSpeed and getMaxSpeed methods are no longer available (not deprecated, they have been removed from the SDK). Also note that the the new 3.x software incorporates motor profiles that a user can select as he/she configures the robot. Changes include Blocks changes Added VuforiaTrackableDefaultListener.getPose and Vuforia.trackPose blocks. Added optimized blocks support for Vuforia extended tracking. Added atan2 block to the math category. Added useCompetitionFieldTargetLocations parameter to Vuforia.initialize block. If set to false, the target locations are placed at (0,0,0) with target orientation as specified in https//github.com/gearsincorg/FTCVuforiaDemo/blob/master/Robot_Navigation.java tutorial op mode. Incorporates additional improvements to USB comm layer to improve system resiliency (to recover from a greater number of communication disruptions). Additional Notes Regarding Version 3.00 (built on 17.04.13) In addition to the release changes listed below (see section labeled Version 3.00 (built on 17.04.013)), version 3.00 has the following important changes Version 3.00 software uses a new version of the FTC Robocol (robot protocol). If you upgrade to v3.0 on the Robot Controller and/or Android Studio side, you must also upgrade the Driver Station software to match the new Robocol. Version 3.00 software removes the setMaxSpeed and getMaxSpeed methods from the DcMotor class. If you have an op mode that formerly used these methods, you will need to remove the references/calls to these methods. Instead, v3.0 provides the max speed information through the use of motor profiles that are selected by the user during robot configuration. Version 3.00 software currently does not have a mechanism to disable extra i2c sensors. We hope to re-introduce this function with a release in the near future. Version 3.00 (built on 17.04.13)  Use this version of the software at YOUR OWN RISK!!!  This software is being released as an alpha version. Use this version at your own risk! This pre-release software contains SIGNIFICANT changes, including changes to the Wi-Fi Direct pairing mechanism, rewrites of the I2C sensor classes, changes to the USB/FTDI layer, and the introduction of support for the REV Robotics Expansion Hub and the REV Robotics color-range-light sensor. These changes were implemented to improve the reliability and resiliency of the FTC control system. Please note, however, that version 3.00 is considered alpha code. This code is being released so that the FIRST community will have an opportunity to test the new REV Expansion Hub electronics module when it becomes available in May. The developers do not recommend using this code for critical applications (i.e., competition use).  Use this version of the software at YOUR OWN RISK!!!  Changes include Major rework of sensor-related infrastructure. Includes rewriting sensor classes to implement synchronous I2C communication. Fix to reset Autonomous timer back to 30 seconds. Implementation of specific motor profiles for approved 12V motors (includes Tetrix, AndyMark, Matrix and REV models). Modest improvements to enhance Wi-Fi P2P pairing.

Channel change is enabled in the FTC Robot Controller app for Moto G 2nd and 3rd Gen phones. Users can now use annotations to register/disable their Op Modes. Changes in the Android SDK, JDK and build tool requirements (minsdk19, java 1.7, build tools 23.0.3). Standardized units in analog input. Cleaned up code for existing analog sensor classes. setChannelMode and getChannelMode were REMOVED from the DcMotorController class. This is important - we no longer set the motor modes through the motor controller. setMode and getMode were added to the DcMotor class. ContinuousRotationServo class has been added to the FTC SDK. Range.clip() method has been overloaded so it can support this operation for int, short and byte integers. Some changes have been made (new methods added) on how a user can access items from the hardware map. Users can now set the zero power behavior for a DC motor so that the motor will brake or float when power is zero. Prototype Blockly Programming Mode has been added to FTC Robot Controller. Users can place the Robot Controller into this mode, and then use a device (such as a laptop) that has a Javascript enabled browser to write Blockly-based Op Modes directly onto the Robot Controller. Users can now configure the robot remotely through the FTC Driver Station app. Android Studio project supports Android Studio 2.1.x and compile SDK Version 23 (Marshmallow). Vuforia Computer Vision SDK integrated into FTC SDK. Users can use sample vision targets to get localization information on a standard FTC field. Project structure has been reorganized so that there is now a TeamCode package that users can use to place their local/custom Op Modes into this package. Inspection function has been integrated into the FTC Robot Controller and Driver Station Apps (Thanks Team HazMat 9277  10650!). Audio cues have been incorporated into FTC SDK. Swap mechanism added to FTC Robot Controller configuration activity. For example, if you have two motor controllers on a robot, and you misidentified them in your configuration file, you can use the Swap button to swap the devices within the configuration file (so you do not have to manually re-enter in the configuration info for the two devices). Fix mechanism added to all user to replace an electronic module easily. For example, suppose a servo controller dies on your robot. You replace the broken module with a new module, which has a different serial number from the original servo controller. You can use the Fix button to automatically reconfigure your configuration file to use the serial number of the new module. Improvements made to fix resiliency and responsiveness of the system. For LinearOpMode the user now must for a telemetry.update() to update the telemetry data on the driver station. This update() mechanism ensures that the driver station gets the updated data properly and at the same time. The Auto Configure function of the Robot Controller is now template based. If there is a commonly used robot configuration, a template can be created so that the Auto Configure mechanism can be used to quickly configure a robot of this type. The logic to detect a runaway op mode (both in the LinearOpMode and OpMode types) and to abort the run, then auto recover has been improved/implemented. Fix has been incorporated so that Logitech F310 gamepad mappings will be correct for Marshmallow users. Release 16.07.08 For the ftc_app project, the gradle files have been modified to support Android Studio 2.1.x. Release 16.03.30 For the MIT App Inventor, the design blocks have new icons that better represent the function of each design component. Some changes were made to the shutdown logic to ensure the robust shutdown of some of our USB services. A change was made to LinearOpMode so as to allow a given instance to be executed more than once, which is required for the App Inventor. Javadoc improved/updated. Release 16.03.09 Changes made to make the FTC SDK synchronous (significant change!) waitOneFullHardwareCycle() and waitForNextHardwareCycle() are no longer needed and have been deprecated. runOpMode() (for a LinearOpMode) is now decoupled from the systems hardware read/write thread. loop() (for an OpMode) is now decoupled from the systems hardware read/write thread. Methods are synchronous. For example, if you call setMode(DcMotorController.RunMode.RESET_ENCODERS) for a motor, the encoder is guaranteed to be reset when the method call is complete. For legacy module (NXT compatible), user no longer has to toggle between read and write modes when reading from or writing to a legacy device. Changes made to enhance reliability/robustness during ESD event. Changes made to make code thread safe. Debug keystore added so that user-generated robot controller APKs will all use the same signed key (to avoid conflicts if a team has multiple developer laptops for example). Firmware version information for Modern Robotics modules are now logged. Changes made to improve USB comm reliability and robustness. Added support for voltage indicator for legacy (NXT-compatible) motor controllers. Changes made to provide auto stop capabilities for op modes. A LinearOpMode class will stop when the statements in runOpMode() are complete. User does not have to push the stop button on the driver station. If an op mode is stopped by the driver station, but there is a run away/uninterruptible thread persisting, the app will log an error message then force itself to crash to stop the runaway thread. Driver Station UI modified to display lowest measured voltage below current voltage (12V battery). Driver Station UI modified to have color background for current voltage (greengood, yellowcaution, reddanger, extremely low voltage). javadoc improved (edits and additional classes). Added app build time to About activity for driver station and robot controller apps. Display local IP addresses on Driver Station About activity. Added I2cDeviceSynchImpl. Added I2cDeviceSync interface. Added seconds() and milliseconds() to ElapsedTime for clarity. Added getCallbackCount() to I2cDevice. Added missing clearI2cPortActionFlag. Added code to create log messages while waiting for LinearOpMode shutdown. Fix so Wifi Direct Config activity will no longer launch multiple times. Added the ability to specify an alternate i2c address in software for the Modern Robotics gyro. Release 16.02.09 Improved battery checker feature so that voltage values get refreshed regularly (every 250 msec) on Driver Station (DS) user interface. Improved software so that Robot Controller (RC) is much more resilient and self-healing to USB disconnects If user attempts to start/restart RC with one or more module missing, it will display a warning but still start up. When running an op mode, if one or more modules gets disconnected, the RC  DS will display warnings,and robot will keep on working in spite of the missing module(s). If a disconnected module gets physically reconnected the RC will auto detect the module and the user will regain control of the recently connected module. Warning messages are more helpful (identifies the type of module thats missing plus its USB serial number). Code changes to fix the null gamepad reference when users try to reference the gamepads in the init() portion of their op mode. NXT light sensor output is now properly scaled. Note that teams might have to readjust their light threshold values in their op modes. On DS user interface, gamepad icon for a driver will disappear if the matching gamepad is disconnected or if that gamepad gets designated as a different driver. Robot Protocol (ROBOCOL) version number info is displayed in About screen on RC and DS apps. Incorporated a display filter on pairing screen to filter out devices that dont use the - format. This filter can be turned off to show all WiFi Direct devices. Updated text in License file. Fixed formatting error in OpticalDistanceSensor.toString(). Fixed issue on with a blank () device name that would disrupt WiFi Direct Pairing. Made a change so that the WiFi info and battery info can be displayed more quickly on the DS upon connecting to RC. Improved javadoc generation. Modified code to make it easier to support language localization in the future. Release 16.01.04 Updated compileSdkVersion for apps Prevent Wifi from entering power saving mode removed unused import from driver station Corrrected Dead zone joystick code. LED.getDeviceName and .getConnectionInfo() return null apps check for ROBOCOL_VERSION mismatch Fix for Telemetry also has off-by-one errors in its data string sizing / short size limitations error User telemetry output is sorted. added formatting variants to DbgLog and RobotLog APIs code modified to allow for a long list of op mode names. changes to improve thread safety of RobocolDatagramSocket Fix for missing hardware leaves robot controller disconnected from driver station error fix for fast tapping of Init/Start causes problems (toast is now only instantiated on UI thread). added some log statements for thread life cycle. moved gamepad reset logic inside of initActiveOpMode() for robustness changes made to mitigate risk of race conditions on public methods. changes to try and flag when WiFi Direct name contains non-printable characters. fix to correct race condition between .run() and .close() in ReadWriteRunnableStandard. updated FTDI driver made ReadWriteRunnableStanard interface public. fixed off-by-one errors in Command constructor moved specific hardware implmentations into their own package. moved specific gamepad implemnatations to the hardware library. changed LICENSE file to new BSD version. fixed race condition when shutting down Modern Robotics USB devices. methods in the ColorSensor classes have been synchronized. corrected isBusy() status to reflect end of motion. corrected back button keycode. the notSupported() method of the GyroSensor class was changed to protected (it should not be public). Release 15.11.04.001 Added Support for Modern Robotics Gyro. The GyroSensor class now supports the MR Gyro Sensor. Users can access heading data (about Z axis) Users can also access raw gyro data (X, Y,  Z axes). Example MRGyroTest.java op mode included. Improved error messages More descriptive error messages for exceptions in user code. Updated DcMotor API Enable read mode on new address in setI2cAddress Fix so that driver station app resets the gamepads when switching op modes. USB-related code changes to make USB comm more responsive and to display more explicit error messages. Fix so that USB will recover properly if the USB bus returns garbage data. Fix USB initializtion race condition. Better error reporting during FTDI open. More explicit messages during USB failures. Fixed bug so that USB device is closed if event loop teardown method was not called. Fixed timer UI issue Fixed duplicate name UI bug (Legacy Module configuration). Fixed race condition in EventLoopManager. Fix to keep references stable when updating gamepad. For legacy Matrix motor/servo controllers removed necessity of appending Motor and Servo to controller names. Updated HT color sensor driver to use constants from ModernRoboticsUsbLegacyModule class. Updated MR color sensor driver to use constants from ModernRoboticsUsbDeviceInterfaceModule class. Correctly handle I2C Address change in all color sensors Updated/cleaned up op modes. Updated comments in LinearI2cAddressChange.java example op mode. Replaced the calls to setChannelMode with setMode (to match the new of the DcMotor method). Removed K9AutoTime.java op mode. Added MRGyroTest.java op mode (demonstrates how to use MR Gyro Sensor). Added MRRGBExample.java op mode (demonstrates how to use MR Color Sensor). Added HTRGBExample.java op mode (demonstrates how to use HT legacy color sensor). Added MatrixControllerDemo.java (demonstrates how to use legacy Matrix controller). Updated javadoc documentation. Updated release .apk files for Robot Controller and Driver Station apps. Release 15.10.06.002 Added support for Legacy Matrix 9.6V motor/servo controller. Cleaned up build.gradle file. Minor UI and bug fixes for driver station and robot controller apps. Throws error if Ultrasonic sensor (NXT) is not configured for legacy module port 4 or 5. Release 15.08.03.001 New user interfaces for FTC Driver Station and FTC Robot Controller apps. An init() method is added to the OpMode class. For this release, init() is triggered right before the start() method. Eventually, the init() method will be triggered when the user presses an INIT button on driver station. The init() and loop() methods are now required (i.e., need to be overridden in the users op mode). The start() and stop() methods are optional. A new LinearOpMode class is introduced. Teams can use the LinearOpMode mode to create a linear (not event driven) program model. Teams can use blocking statements like Thread.sleep() within a linear op mode. The API for the Legacy Module and Core Device Interface Module have been updated. Support for encoders with the Legacy Module is now working. The hardware loop has been updated for better performance.",repository,

With the market being what it is, I am leaning on my network and trying to figure out how best to differentiate. The main question do I dig in, or pivot for better opportunities (if they exist)? Possible paths I am considering - Continuing as a boutique consultant (agency site, marketing, outreach, network) - Project management contracting - Cloud infrastructure (expanding beyond my basic web dev cloud skills) - Data and integrations (SQL migrations, automation, jobs) - Database administration - LLM integrations, prototyping, and rollouts - Fractional CTO work - Building my own app (riskier, longer-term) - Learning new skills (data science, AI/ML, advanced LLM work) Strengths breaking down processes, managing international teams, delivering client projects. Ive been all about delivery the last 15 years. Looking for feedback on - Which of these skills are most marketable for contracting right now? - Whether to pivot, stay broad, or narrow focus? - Best entry points into strong contracting opportunities? I am open to different engagement styles - Short-term spikes (up to 80 hours/week) - Seasonal contracts (39 months at 40 hours/week) - Ongoing fractional work (520 hours/week/client) Thoughts from staffing folks, recruiters, or experienced devs are welcome. TLDR 15 yrs US-based consultant (cloud/web/mobile  some LLM work). Market is weird, debating whether to double down on current path or pivot.

Reddit,"My Moms Old Boss Is Having An Absolute Meltdown Because She Quit, And The Reason Is Just Golden.",R/Jobs,"My mom worked for this small local firm for about 8 years. For years, weve all been telling her shes underpaid. She was basically running the whole office for the owner, who drives a new Porsche every year, but her salary barely budged. When she finally got the courage to ask for a real raise, he shot her down flat. So, after a little encouragement, she quietly started looking around. She found an opening at a larger competitor. Even though she didnt have the degree they listed, her years of solid experience got her in the door. After a couple of rounds of interviews, they made her an offer within three weeks for nearly double her salary, going from 60k to 110k plus real benefits. But heres the best part. When she went to put in her notice, her old boss completely lost it. He started calling her constantly with frantic counter-offers. During one of these calls, he offered to beat the new salary and looked her right in the eye, saying, I know I wasnt paying you what you were actually worth to me. The absolute audacity. Admitting he knew he was undervaluing her for all those years while she was raising two kids on her own. And can I just say, Im getting really tired of people like u/sammyhannyiiwww just commented now deleted trying to suggest my mom should have used some sketchy AI tool for interview assistance.

Reddit,They Canceled My Contract Because I Caught Them Committing Fraud,R/Jobs,"For a year, Ive been working with a company run by a millionaire guy and his fiance. At first I was contracted to do part time assistant work with the fiance. However, they broke up and I was plunged head-first into handling all of their finances, and pretty much anything else (I have experience in bookeeping, but not for their industry and not with their software). This is when I learned the guy was a nighmare. I believe he has Narcissistic Personality Disorder - hes the victim in every situation, yet he is an arrogant piece of shit who bullies people, doesnt pay his subcontractors as agreed, and he shit on me from day 1 because I didnt know everything instantly. He had no knowledge of anything either. I worked my ass off...60 hour weeks trying to keep up with everything and learn at the same time (and was only paid for 40 of those weekly hours). He screamed at me, belittled me, etc. I wanted to leave but the money was good and I needed it to support my family. Edit They got back together. I later caught them committing bank fraud, tax fraud, and mail fraud. It was downhill from there, because as the finance person, I told them I wouldnt touch anything that wasnt legitimate. I had access to their emails, because I frequently looked for receipts, contracts to sign, etc. I found a meeting summary where it was discussed with an outside contractor that I would be leaving in 1-1.5 months. I was not notified. I tried to get a meeting with either of them they refused to reply to texts, emails, meeting invites. They were never going to tell me. Our contract says 30 days notice is required. I finally reached the fiance by leaving a very calm message saying I knew, and Id appreciate a call back. She did, to her credit. I asked why I was never told and she said I knew it would be a hard conversation. She claimed this was a money issue, and it was her fiance that made the decision. Pretty sure shes lying. People are garbage sometimes. Especially those who make millions. I guess thats how they get there to begin with. ETA Dont worry folks, Im definitely going to report, then update...might be a couple of months tho. I have emails where the literally wrote an SOP on how to do this, many emails of examples of this happening, and 2 videos of them admitting it. SMDH. Thanks for the support!!

Reddit,After 8 Months Unemployed And 200 Applications Later I Finally Got The Job!,R/Jobs,"After 8 long months of unemployment filled with rejection, ghosting, and endless applications (over 200 in total), Im beyond excited to share that I finally landed my dream job! For the past 9 years, I worked in early childhood education, but Ive been eager to transition into an office-based career. The journey hasnt been easy. I assume that most employers saw my childcare background and didnt want to take a chance on me. I went through only four interviews in all those months, and Ill admit there were times I questioned myself and struggled to stay positive. This most recent process was different. Instead of a traditional first interview, I recorded short video responses to their questions. It felt awkward at first, but it gave me the time and space to think through my answers without the pressure of being face to face. To my surprise, I heard back the very next day with an invitation for an in-person interview. That interview was unlike anything I had ever experienced. I felt an immediate connection, like I was talking with old friends. Our values aligned, the conversation flowed, and I left feeling more confident than I had in months. Something in me just knew I was meant to be there. Sure enough, less than 24 hours later, I got the call! I was offered the job with a higher pay rate than discussed, plus benefits, PTO, and a 401k (things Id never had in childcare). To say Im overjoyed would be an understatement. Im sharing this to encourage anyone currently in the job-search trenches. Dont give up. The right opportunity is out there, even if it feels impossible at times.

The only exception was someone in the Netherlands who said they could move forward if I spoke Dutch which I dont. Im really confused because  I studied at top universities.  Right after graduation, I joined a multinational company.  Im currently a Procurement Manager at just 28 years old. On paper, everyone tells me it should be easy for me to land a job. But the reality is I cant even get a single interview. Ive attached my CV here. Could you please take a look and tell me whats wrong or what I could improve? Thanks a lot in advance",discussion,526
Reddit,Friend Might Be Getting Replaced After 7 Years At Her Job,R/Jobs,"So my friend has been working as a supervisor in a medical center for 7 years. Shes always been the type of employee who goes above and beyond  smart, hardworking, reliable, the whole package. Recently, they hired another supervisor. Ever since he showed up, hes been trying to turn the director against her, saying she doesnt deserve her position. On top of that, he nitpicks the tiniest mistakes she makes and blows them way out of proportion to the director. The problem is, the directors kinda spineless and just goes along with whatever he hears. Now shes hearing from outside sources that the director might actually be thinking about replacing her. Shes super shocked and honestly doesnt know what to do. This job has been her second home for almost a decade and shes given so much to it. She doesnt want to jump to conclusions if its just rumors, but at the same time she feels betrayed and really uncertain about whats next. If you were in her shoes, would you confront the boss, just wait it out, or quietly start looking for another job?",discussion,4

Reddit,Targetjs A Ui Framework Where Time Is Declarative (No Async/Await Chains),R/Programming,"Ive been building a small JavaScript UI framework called TargetJS and would love feedback from this community. It takes a fundamentally different approach to front-end development, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations and complex UI flows. The core idea is that it unifies everythingUI, state, APIs, and animationsinto a single concept called targets. Instead of using async/await or chaining promises and callbacks, the execution flow is determined by two simple postfixes   (Reactive) Runs every time the preceding target updates.   (Deferred) Runs only after the preceding targets have fully completed all their operations. This means you can write a complex sequence of events, like add button - animate it - when done add another element - animate that - when done fetch API - show user data and the code reads almost like a step-by-step list, top-to-bottom. The framework handles all the asynchronous plumbing for you. I think it works really well for applications with a lot of animation or real-time data fetching such as games, interactive dashboards, or rich single-page apps, where managing state and async operations can become a headache. What do you think of this approach? Have you seen anything similar?

Reddit,"Im Done With This Job, Its Time To Move On",R/Itcareerquestions,"Hi everyone, Im 21 and working as a IT FIELD TECHNICAN through Dell/Unisys. Ive been in the role for about 10 months now and Im honestly planning to leave next month. The travel is killing me. I spend around 2 hours just to go pick up parts, then more time driving to different customer sites, and then another 1.5hours back home. Im just sick and tired driving in London , theres so much traffic and roads are all 20mph! My car is starting to fall apart from all the driving (overheating, coolant issues, battery problems)- I dont trust it in long journey and its stressing me out (Ive spent a lot of money replacing car parts but looks like I got a cracked cylinder or head gasket issue ). On top of that, I dont feel like Im learning anything new and the pay is awful once petrol is taken out. The positive side is that Ive already had a few interviews for IT roles and Im studying for Network. After that I plan to go for Security. In terms of experience Ive been  Repairing laptops, desktops and workstations (motherboards, LCDs, RAM, SSDs etc)  Deploying and configuring Windows OS, imaging, BIOS and drivers  Troubleshooting OS and hardware issues  Using networking fundamentals (IP, DNS, DHCP) to test and restore connectivity  Some Active Directory experience through a homelab  Logging tickets, escalation, working directly with customers Do you think this is enough experience to move into another IT role (2nd line, service desk, NOC etc)? Or should I wait it out longer even though the job is draining me? My end goal is to be a Network engineer (I will start my CCNA NEXT YEAR) but I need some 2nd line Support experience before I move on to it.",discussion,51

Reddit,Why Do You Guys Do It Work?,R/Itcareerquestions,"Honestly wasnt sure how to word this. Im currently in school for networking and as Im doing these lab assignments and such, I just cant find a real reason to care about anything Im doing. It all SEEMS the same as well. Like, Is it really all just configuration and checks? I understand WHY this is important for a company but WHY is this important for ME? Im sure the obvious answer is so I can have a job and so I can get paid but I meanthats it? No fairy glitter and high energy music?  A big chunk of me was hoping that this would be fun. While it definitely is pretty easy so far, I just cant find a reason to stay motivated and actually look forward to doing this as a career. I dont know if these labs are a good representation of real life work but it feels pretty soulless so far. I thought the physical parts were fun, working with the cables and servers to troubleshoot and check connections, but the terminal work is so dead. I just sit at a computer and type in random numbers that someone told me to type in to get random numbers that someone said they needed lol. I dont know, I feel weird to complain about this because who wouldnt want something that easy right? But at the same time, it is pretty damn boring.

Leadership replacements across the board, having to take on tasks that 3 director level people worked on. I have not had work life balance at all recently. Multiple major audit projects with less hands helping, falling behind on commitments as a result of having less hands helping, expectations piling on and on. I tried to communicate how overwhelmed I am, and I couldnt get through. Really close to just resigning this week, and using the job search time as a mental health break because I cant give it my all anymore.

Reddit,Would Joining The Us Military Make It Easier To Finally Get My Foot In The Door In It?,R/Itcareerquestions,"Its been 2 years already for me, and so far Ive only landed 2 internships in software development while working in hospitality at a casino. Ive applied to full-time entry-level roles in SWE, Product, PM, QA, Data, and even Help Desk jobs (that still demands IT certs and yet pays hella low), but I still havent had any luck. Thats how brutal and competitive the job market is in IT. I am in North California. Would I have more open options, maybe with less competition, and finally get my foot in the door in IT if I enlist in the military? I already have a college degree, but I cant apply for officer roles through OTS yet since Im only a permanent resident (green card holder) in the US. So my only option for now is through enlistment. Right now, life is pretty decent and working at a casino earns me decently good that reaches me at about 2836/hr range (depends on tips) in California with free unlimited food through employee dining and good benefits. Should I just wait it out, keep applying to civilian companies, and hope for a better job market soon, or should I start the enlistment process now and push through some hardships? Ive heard that jobs and roles in the military can be competitive too? With harsh environment, the possibility of being stationed somewhere you dont want, and pay that might not even be higher (correct me if im wrong) for the few years as an enlisted than what Im earning at the casino right now, etc. Right now, I enjoy being able to socialize, explore the cities I like, and attend music festivals which are things I genuinely enjoy and might not have the freedom to do if I enlist in the military. Any thoughts, opinions, or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated.",discussion,40
Reddit,Career Switch Or Deep Dive In Existing Role?,R/Itcareerquestions,"To give some context, I work in a prestigious services based IT company with global outreach currently working on an ERP Support Project serving a retail giant client based in US. I am in a Functional QA testing role related to mostly manual testing on ERP UI application for 3 years. The client uses an on-prem version of retail ERP. I have a management degree and got hired in the company as a fresher and dont have any coding related background. I can use basic SQL queries to extract data from client database mostly for testing purposes. I am now in a conundrum since I do not see any good opportunities ahead. Being just a functional resource with very little technical skills can become a liability very quickly in my field and I am thinking of upscaling or upskilling myself. I can think of 3 major pathways 1. Stay in the same field and fine tune my functional knowledge. Try to get out of onprem project and get into a cloud based project by completing few certifications for the same. The effort is relatively less but competition is very high. We have many folks with good technical knowledge trying to switch to a functional role in cloud. 2. Learn QA Automation tools which will help me to slowly transition to a techno-functional role and gradually shift to automation completely. I would most probably need to learn JAVA will doing my job. Available roles are not as much as cloud functional roles and effort required would be medium to high. I am not sure of competition but it is relatively lower than for cloud functional roles. 3. Completely shift the career and do an external Data Analytics course, moving away from my current workstream. I would need to learn database management, SQL, Big data tools like MongoDB, data analytics tools like Python. Required effort would be extremely high and current job market may or may not be suitable for my expected CTC after working 3 years in my current field. Which of the above options would be most suitable for me and what course of action should I follow to achieve expected goal? New/Alternate suggestions are welcome!",discussion,1

Reddit,Interviewing For Sysadmin Position Not Prepared Whatsoever,R/Itcareerquestions,"I worked in IT as a Tier 1 in a small MSP about 2 - 3 years ago. The lead (the only one with a real SysAdmin title) often said in both jest and seriousness that we were really Tier 3s because of the kinds of tickets we were expected to complete a lot of server admin (linux/windows), networking tickets, I did some custom powershell scripting / wrote some code for our NOC screens, on top of the seemingly endless Tier 1 type tickets. The work wasnt that impressive to me, being someone who did these kinds of things as a hobby. I left that MSP (the pay was miserable) and I took a job in an unrelated industry (engineering tech work in aviation). On a whim, I applied to a SysAdmin job with a well-known government contractor. Im shocked that I received an invitation to interview and, being away from pretty much all things tech/IT for three years now, ad well as not having any certifications, I feel woefully unprepared. A few questions 1. Is it worth cramming for the next four days before the interview? Ideal SysAdmin experience is so wide that I know for a fact I wont be able to cover all bases, or even the specific knowledge area requirements for the position. 2. Is it still possible to be successful in this role on the off chance I am given a formal offer? 2a. Is it still acceptable for a SysAdmin to google solutions to things often? Just need both a confidence boost and reality check here. Thanks guys",discussion,8
